# AI Animal Communication: Foresight Report

## 1. Executive Summary  
Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are rapidly expanding into the realm of animal communication.  Today’s machine learning tools can sift through huge datasets of animal sounds, gestures and other signals to identify patterns beyond human intuition ([www.weforum.org](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/01/how-artificial-intelligence-is-getting-us-closer-to-talking-to-animals/#:~:text=For%20years%2C%20artificial%20intelligence%20,and%20voice%20command%20smart%20devices)) ([www.sciencefocus.com](https://www.sciencefocus.com/news/talking-to-animals-ai#:~:text=She%20said%20we%20could%20train,of%20footage%20of%20animal%20interactions)).  For example, researchers at the Earth Species Project (ESP) and others report that, with enough data, it is becoming feasible to “decode animal communication” and even envisage “two-way communication with another species” in coming decades ([www.weforum.org](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/01/how-artificial-intelligence-is-getting-us-closer-to-talking-to-animals/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20are%20on%20the%20cusp,way%20communication%20with%20another)) ([www.sciencefocus.com](https://www.sciencefocus.com/news/talking-to-animals-ai#:~:text=She%20said%20we%20could%20train,of%20footage%20of%20animal%20interactions)).  High-profile efforts (e.g. Project CETI for whales, Google’s bioacoustics models) already demonstrate AI identifying whale species and calls ([research.google](https://research.google/blog/whistles-songs-boings-and-biotwangs-recognizing-whale-vocalizations-with-ai/#:~:text=We%20introduce%20our%20new%20whale,attributed%20to%20the%20Bryde%E2%80%99s%20whale)) ([gizmodo.com](https://gizmodo.com/ai-is-deciphering-animal-speech-should-we-try-to-talk-back-2000598783#:~:text=Towards%20the%20front%20of%20the,working%20on%20%209%20ethical)).  The goal is to translate these patterns into meaningful information about animals’ needs, emotions and social structures. 

The potential applications are vast: from conservation (identifying new species or monitoring ecosystem health via soundscapes ([www.weforum.org](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/01/how-artificial-intelligence-is-getting-us-closer-to-talking-to-animals/#:~:text=For%20instance%2C%20in%202021%2C%20researchers,Nature%20article%20detailing%20the%20discovery)) ([www.weforum.org](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/01/how-artificial-intelligence-is-getting-us-closer-to-talking-to-animals/#:~:text=Moreover%2C%20listening%20to%20ecosystems%20and,reforested%20areas%20of%20the%20rainforest))) to farm animal welfare (e.g. EU SoundWel aims to use pig vocal cues to assess stress levels) to pet care (imagining a “Dr. Dolittle” vet who reads a dog’s signals directly ([www.sciencefocus.com](https://www.sciencefocus.com/news/talking-to-animals-ai#:~:text=In%20the%20future%2C%20French%20thinks,chat))).  Advocates note that better access to animal “voices” could foster empathy and legal reforms: the capacity for animals to ‘speak’ might finally boost their moral and legal standing in ways that visible suffering alone has not ([atmos.earth](https://atmos.earth/using-ai-to-decode-animal-communication/#:~:text=terms%20have%20to%20do%20with,right%20to%20safety%20and%20wellbeing)) ([sentientmedia.org](https://sentientmedia.org/ai-animal-communication-breakthroughs/#:~:text=Increasing%20our%20understanding%20of%20animal,increase%20our%20empathy%20towards%20them)).  However, experts also warn of risks.  Animals may not want human interaction – “maybe if they could talk… they would tell us to go away” ([www.weforum.org](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/01/how-artificial-intelligence-is-getting-us-closer-to-talking-to-animals/#:~:text=communication%20channels%20between%20humans%20and,animals%E2%80%94or%20animals%20and%20machines)) – and misusing or misinterpreting their signals could inflict harm.  Recent analyses call for proactive ethical guardrails, arguing that technologies should prioritize animals’ interests (autonomy, privacy, dignity) over mere human convenience ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-025-00828-z#:~:text=initiatives%2C%20the%20technical%20frontier%20is,to%20argue%20for%20proactive%2C%20principled)) ([gizmodo.com](https://gizmodo.com/ai-is-deciphering-animal-speech-should-we-try-to-talk-back-2000598783#:~:text=A%20recent%20paper%20on%20the,are%20already%20under%20serious%20threat)). 

This report analyzes the drivers (technical advances, data collection, funding and social interest) propelling this field, and catalogs emerging signals (new projects, patents, benchmarks). It then maps opportunities (e.g. conservation gains, new services, scientific discovery) against risks (miscommunication, exploitation, ethical harms) in an opportunity/risk matrix. We outline three scenarios – *Symbiotic Communication*, *Commercial Exploitation*, and *Cautious Regulation* – to explore possible futures by ~2040. Finally, we draw out strategic implications: biotechnology and AI companies, conservationists and policymakers must prepare for a future where animals occupy the conversational table. In all cases, multi-disciplinary collaboration and ethics-led governance will be crucial to ensure that “giving animals a voice” truly advances their welfare and our coexistence ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-025-00828-z#:~:text=initiatives%2C%20the%20technical%20frontier%20is,to%20argue%20for%20proactive%2C%20principled)) ([atmos.earth](https://atmos.earth/using-ai-to-decode-animal-communication/#:~:text=terms%20have%20to%20do%20with,right%20to%20safety%20and%20wellbeing)).

## 2. Key Drivers  
1. **Advances in AI and Machine Learning.**  Modern ML (especially deep learning and large-language-model architectures) excels at pattern recognition in complex data.  Techniques developed for human language and computer vision are being repurposed to animal data: for instance, Google’s DolphinGemma and Dog-models show that speech-model architectures can be retrained on dolphin or dog audio to infer calls and emotions ([gizmodo.com](https://gizmodo.com/ai-is-deciphering-animal-speech-should-we-try-to-talk-back-2000598783#:~:text=Meanwhile%2C%20Google%20and%20the%20Wild,groundwork%20for%20future%20interspecies%20dialogue)) ([gizmodo.com](https://gizmodo.com/ai-is-deciphering-animal-speech-should-we-try-to-talk-back-2000598783#:~:text=Outside%20the%20ocean%2C%20researchers%20are,language%20model%20architectures%20could%20be)).  Earth Species Project and others explicitly apply “large-language-model techniques” to animal vocalizations ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-025-00828-z#:~:text=AI,that%20animal%20communication%20systems%20are)).  These methods can even generate plausible animal-like signals (e.g. Google’s model can emit Bryde’s whale “biotwang” calls) ([research.google](https://research.google/blog/whistles-songs-boings-and-biotwangs-recognizing-whale-vocalizations-with-ai/#:~:text=We%20introduce%20our%20new%20whale,attributed%20to%20the%20Bryde%E2%80%99s%20whale)).  In sum, continual ML algorithmic improvements (and the expertise built from GPT-style systems) are a major driver. 

2. **Explosion of Sensing Data.**  Cheap, miniaturized sensors and cameras now record animal sounds and behaviors on an unprecedented scale.  Scientists deploy bioacoustic recorders 24/7 in remote habitats (deep oceans, rainforests, Arctic) ([www.weforum.org](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/01/how-artificial-intelligence-is-getting-us-closer-to-talking-to-animals/#:~:text=AI%20analysis%20is%20possible%20and%2C,worldwide%20to%20source%20data%20collections)) ([sentientmedia.org](https://sentientmedia.org/ai-animal-communication-breakthroughs/#:~:text=When%20it%20comes%20to%20collecting,then%20help%20us%20discover%20the)).  The resulting “big data” enables AI to learn subtle patterns otherwise invisible.  As one researcher noted, portable recorders “record continuously, 24/7” to feed data-hungry AI ([sentientmedia.org](https://sentientmedia.org/ai-animal-communication-breakthroughs/#:~:text=When%20it%20comes%20to%20collecting,then%20help%20us%20discover%20the)).  Likewise, advances in tracking and video (see EPFL’s 2024 *SuperAnimal* model that tracks pose across 45 species ([actu.epfl.ch](https://actu.epfl.ch/news/unifying-behavioral-analysis-through-animal-foun-5#:~:text=The%20%E2%80%9CSuperAnimal%20method%E2%80%9D%20is%20an,this%20new%20Nature%20technology%20feature))) provide large annotated image datasets. This data proliferation directly fuels AI’s ability to “detect subtle patterns often overlooked by human analysis” ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-025-00828-z#:~:text=Exponential%20growth%20in%20bioacoustic%20data%2C,AI%20system%20capable%20of%20interpreting)). 

3. **Dedicated Research Initiatives and Funding.**  New programs explicitly target interspecies communication.  Nonprofits like Earth Species Project (ESP) and Project CETI have sprung up to lead this work.  ESP has rallied over 40 partner labs worldwide to collect bioacoustic datasets and released an open **BEANS** benchmark for animal sounds ([www.weforum.org](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/01/how-artificial-intelligence-is-getting-us-closer-to-talking-to-animals/#:~:text=bioacoustics%2C%20the%20recording%20of%20individual,learning%20classification%20and%20detection%20performance)).  In academia, grants and collaborations (e.g. U.S. NOAA with Google for whale calls ([research.google](https://research.google/blog/whistles-songs-boings-and-biotwangs-recognizing-whale-vocalizations-with-ai/#:~:text=Google%20Research%E2%80%99s%20journey%20with%20whale,made%20further%20%E2%80%9Csplashes%E2%80%9D%20with%20this))) accelerate progress.  Philanthropists and governments are signaling interest: for example, in 2024 the Jeremy Coller Foundation announced the $10M “Coller-Dolittle” Challenge to crack two-way animal communication ([sentientmedia.org](https://sentientmedia.org/ai-animal-communication-breakthroughs/#:~:text=Some%20foundations%20are%20betting%20money,the%20code%E2%80%9D%20on%20animal%20communication)).  The EU’s SoundWel project (see SoundWel website) is explicitly funding AI tools to read pig vocal emotions for welfare ([www.soundwel-project.eu](https://www.soundwel-project.eu/#:~:text=The%20SOUNDWEL%20project%20is%20funded,Germany)).  These initiatives provide both resources and legitimacy, moving the field from fringe to funded research. 

4. **Conservation and Welfare Imperatives.**  Urgent ecological and animal welfare needs are stimulating this research.  Biodiversity loss and human impact compel better monitoring of wildlife.  AI-decoding of calls is already used in conservation: researchers used sound analysis to discover a new blue whale “acoustic population” in 2021 ([www.weforum.org](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/01/how-artificial-intelligence-is-getting-us-closer-to-talking-to-animals/#:~:text=For%20instance%2C%20in%202021%2C%20researchers,Nature%20article%20detailing%20the%20discovery)) and to design dynamic marine-protected-area routes that help whales avoid ships ([www.weforum.org](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/01/how-artificial-intelligence-is-getting-us-closer-to-talking-to-animals/#:~:text=AI%20analysis%20of%20animal%20communication,coalitions%20between%20animals%20and%20ships)).  Likewise, pet and farm animal welfare concerns drive interest in non-human communication.  Veterinary experts foresee AI aides in clinics detecting hidden pain or illness (e.g. rabbits hiding symptoms) by reading signals beyond our senses ([resources.aiforanimals.org](https://resources.aiforanimals.org/ai-for-animals-wiki/why-talking-to-animals-could-soon-become-a-reality#:~:text=The%20article%20discusses%20how%20AI,and%20environments%2C%20raising%20ethical%20concerns)) ([www.sciencefocus.com](https://www.sciencefocus.com/news/talking-to-animals-ai#:~:text=In%20the%20future%2C%20French%20thinks,chat)).  In short, the combination of environmental urgency and concern for animal well-being propels funding and attention toward interspecies communication. 

5. **Social and Cultural Factors.**  Public fascination with a “pet translator” and a growing ethic of animal rights amplify momentum.  Popular media (Science Focus, Gizmodo, Vox, etc.) widely cover these breakthroughs, raising awareness.  High-profile statements – such as a vet claiming pet-human translation could be “one of the biggest, most exciting technological advances in the next few decades” ([www.sciencefocus.com](https://www.sciencefocus.com/news/talking-to-animals-ai#:~:text=You%20may%20think%20you%20know,%E2%80%9D)) – stoke public and investor interest.  Projects like Earth Species explicitly aspire to change how humans view their role on the planet by listening to animals ([www.weforum.org](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/01/how-artificial-intelligence-is-getting-us-closer-to-talking-to-animals/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20are%20not%20yet%20sure,exist%20on%20the%20planet.%E2%80%9D)) ([atmos.earth](https://atmos.earth/using-ai-to-decode-animal-communication/#:~:text=terms%20have%20to%20do%20with,right%20to%20safety%20and%20wellbeing)).  Meanwhile, legal and ethical discourse is evolving: for example, NYU’s “More than Human Rights” (MOTH) project is formulating guidelines for AI-mediated animal talk ([atmos.earth](https://atmos.earth/using-ai-to-decode-animal-communication/#:~:text=advance%20rights%20for%20humans%2C%20non,well%20as%20from%20adjacent%20fields)). This cultural shift, from token anthropomorphism toward seeing animals as communicative agents, is a subtle but important driver encouraging investment and experimentation.

## 3. Emerging Signals  
- **Breakthrough Projects & Models.**  Several high-impact projects have released prototypes or results.  Google Research unveiled a multi-species whale-calling AI that recognizes eight whale species’ calls (including the cryptic “biotwang” of Bryde’s whales) ([research.google](https://research.google/blog/whistles-songs-boings-and-biotwangs-recognizing-whale-vocalizations-with-ai/#:~:text=We%20introduce%20our%20new%20whale,attributed%20to%20the%20Bryde%E2%80%99s%20whale)).  In marine research, Google/NOAA used AI to match a ten-year-old mystery sound to Bryde’s whales ([research.google](https://research.google/blog/whistles-songs-boings-and-biotwangs-recognizing-whale-vocalizations-with-ai/#:~:text=the%20decades,broodus)).  Project CETI has analyzed thousands of  sperm whale codas, revealing complex “phonetic” structures in their clicks ([gizmodo.com](https://gizmodo.com/ai-is-deciphering-animal-speech-should-we-try-to-talk-back-2000598783#:~:text=Towards%20the%20front%20of%20the,working%20on%20%209%20ethical)).  On land, a University of Michigan team repurposed the Wav2Vec2 human-voice model to classify dog barks by emotion, gender and breed ([gizmodo.com](https://gizmodo.com/ai-is-deciphering-animal-speech-should-we-try-to-talk-back-2000598783#:~:text=Outside%20the%20ocean%2C%20researchers%20are,language%20model%20architectures%20could%20be)).  Even insects: new lab works track bee dances/sounds to interpret hive communication.  These signals show AI tools are extending across species and modalities: audio, video, and even pheromone data ([sentientmedia.org](https://sentientmedia.org/ai-animal-communication-breakthroughs/#:~:text=Animals%2C%20including%20human%20animals%2C%20make,of%20an%20animal%20in%20distress)). 

- **Open Data & Benchmarks.**  Researchers are organizing shared resources.  In October 2022, ESP published **BEANS**, the first public benchmark of labeled animal sounds for ML ([www.weforum.org](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/01/how-artificial-intelligence-is-getting-us-closer-to-talking-to-animals/#:~:text=bioacoustics%2C%20the%20recording%20of%20individual,learning%20classification%20and%20detection%20performance)).  ESP also open-sourced its flagship *NatureLM-audio* model in 2024, aiming to translate human speech patterns into animal-analog sounds ([gizmodo.com](https://gizmodo.com/ai-is-deciphering-animal-speech-should-we-try-to-talk-back-2000598783#:~:text=The%20Earth%20Species%20Project%20launched,%E2%80%9D)).  By sharing code and data on platforms like Kaggle, these efforts accelerate progress and signal a maturing field. 

- **Patents & Products.**  Private-sector interest is rising.  In 2024 China’s Baidu filed a patent for a cat-translation device: the system would collect a cat’s vocal and behavioral data to infer its emotional state and output a human-language message ([gizmodo.com](https://gizmodo.com/ai-is-deciphering-animal-speech-should-we-try-to-talk-back-2000598783#:~:text=Private%20companies%20,pet%20was%20trying%20to%20convey)).  (A Gizmodo article reports this patent ([gizmodo.com](https://gizmodo.com/ai-is-deciphering-animal-speech-should-we-try-to-talk-back-2000598783#:~:text=Private%20companies%20,pet%20was%20trying%20to%20convey)).)  Similar patents for “pet language translation” devices have appeared globally.  On the consumer side, early “pet translator” gadgets and apps (e.g. MeowTalk for cats) show market startups trying to commercialize rudimentary translation.  These signals indicate entrepreneurs see a future demand, though current products remain very limited in scope. 

- **Academic Publications & Ethics Reviews.**  Scholarly interest is evident.  A 2025 open-access paper (AI & Ethics journal) deeply examines “AI-mediated interspecies communication” ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-025-00828-z#:~:text=The%20prospect%20of%20conversing%20with,considers%20how%20concepts%20such%20as)), highlighting both breakthroughs and urgent moral questions.  Scientific papers (Nature, Frontiers, etc.) regularly report on new findings: e.g. elephants’ use of names, song structure in whales, bees’ cultural learning.  Ethical reviews and interviews (e.g. Sentient Media ([sentientmedia.org](https://sentientmedia.org/ai-animal-communication-breakthroughs/#:~:text=People%20who%20care%20about%20animal,taking%20note%20of%20this%20progress)), Gizmodo ([gizmodo.com](https://gizmodo.com/ai-is-deciphering-animal-speech-should-we-try-to-talk-back-2000598783#:~:text=A%20recent%20paper%20on%20the,are%20already%20under%20serious%20threat)), and Atmos Earth ([atmos.earth](https://atmos.earth/using-ai-to-decode-animal-communication/#:~:text=director%20of%20the%20More%20Than,well%20as%20from%20adjacent%20fields))) are becoming common, often stressing the need for guidelines.  Notably, experts from law (NYU MOTH project ([atmos.earth](https://atmos.earth/using-ai-to-decode-animal-communication/#:~:text=advance%20rights%20for%20humans%2C%20non,well%20as%20from%20adjacent%20fields))) to AI ethics (Rutz et al. on AI-whale issues) are debating frameworks, implying that policy discussions have entered the conversation. 

- **Funding Announcements & Competitions.**  Large prizes and grant programs are emerging.  The $10M Coller-Dolittle Challenge (Israel, 2024) explicitly rewards breakthroughs in two-way interspecies communication ([sentientmedia.org](https://sentientmedia.org/ai-animal-communication-breakthroughs/#:~:text=Some%20foundations%20are%20betting%20money,the%20code%E2%80%9D%20on%20animal%20communication)).  National research funders and philanthropies are noting this space: for example, the EU approved SoundWel funding for animal well-being AI (see soundwel-project.eu) and U.S. agencies are tracking AI in ecology.  Even mainstream tech news (e.g. FT’s *Tech Tonic* podcast) has featured multi-part coverage on the topic ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/418bca4c-8ee1-45c9-952b-cad33c4839a4#:~:text=than%20we%20first%20realise,got%20better%2C%20this%20world%20of)). These signals of institutional support suggest the field is transitioning from fringe curiosity to a recognized scientific endeavor.

- **Cross-Disciplinary Collaborations.**  New networks are forming.  ESP collaborates with dozens of biologists worldwide ([www.weforum.org](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/01/how-artificial-intelligence-is-getting-us-closer-to-talking-to-animals/#:~:text=like%20deep%20seas%20and%20mountain,worldwide%20to%20source%20data%20collections)).  The NYU MOTH initiative is teaming ethicists with whale researchers ([atmos.earth](https://atmos.earth/using-ai-to-decode-animal-communication/#:~:text=advance%20rights%20for%20humans%2C%20non,well%20as%20from%20adjacent%20fields)).  Technologists (from Google to EPFL) are consulting with ethologists and veterinarians (e.g. the *SuperAnimal* team included neuroscientists) ([actu.epfl.ch](https://actu.epfl.ch/news/unifying-behavioral-analysis-through-animal-foun-5#:~:text=The%20%E2%80%9CSuperAnimal%20method%E2%80%9D%20is%20an,this%20new%20Nature%20technology%20feature)) ([actu.epfl.ch](https://actu.epfl.ch/news/unifying-behavioral-analysis-through-animal-foun-5#:~:text=These%20advances%20will%20make%20motion,AmadeusGPT%2C%20published%20recently%20at%20NeurIPS)).  This convergence—AI experts, field biologists, veterinarians, ethicists—is itself a signal that progress will require interdisciplinary work.  

## 4. Opportunity/Risk Matrix  
The following matrix maps key opportunities against attendant risks when applying AI to animal communication:

- **High Opportunity / Low Risk:** *Enhanced Conservation and Welfare.* AI-decoded signals can revolutionize ecological monitoring and animal care with modest downside.  For example, passive acoustic AI already identified a distinct “acoustic population” of blue whales in the Indian Ocean ([www.weforum.org](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/01/how-artificial-intelligence-is-getting-us-closer-to-talking-to-animals/#:~:text=For%20instance%2C%20in%202021%2C%20researchers,Nature%20article%20detailing%20the%20discovery)).  Analogously, sensors analyzing bird or frog calls can rapidly assess biodiversity recovery in reforested areas ([www.weforum.org](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/01/how-artificial-intelligence-is-getting-us-closer-to-talking-to-animals/#:~:text=Moreover%2C%20listening%20to%20ecosystems%20and,reforested%20areas%20of%20the%20rainforest)).  On farms, voice-based welfare tools (like SoundWel’s pig emotional-recognition) could non-invasively improve animal well-being ([www.soundwel-project.eu](https://www.soundwel-project.eu/#:~:text=Project%20SoundWel%20aims%20to%20understand,of%20pigs%20through%20their%20vocalisations)).  In these cases, the gain (better ecosystem data or welfare) is large, while direct harm is minimal if used responsibly.  Properly deployed tools largely “listen” without altering animal behavior, providing high value for conservation and veterinary practice ([actu.epfl.ch](https://actu.epfl.ch/news/unifying-behavioral-analysis-through-animal-foun-5#:~:text=These%20advances%20will%20make%20motion,AmadeusGPT%2C%20published%20recently%20at%20NeurIPS)) ([www.weforum.org](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/01/how-artificial-intelligence-is-getting-us-closer-to-talking-to-animals/#:~:text=Moreover%2C%20listening%20to%20ecosystems%20and,reforested%20areas%20of%20the%20rainforest)).

- **High Opportunity / High Risk:** *Transformative Communication Breakthrough.* Achieving true two-way understanding would unlock unprecedented value (insights into cognition, empowerment of animal rights, etc.) but carries significant danger.  For instance, if we could ask animals about habitat destruction, it might catalyze major ethical and policy shifts.  However, this comes with risks of grave misinterpretation.  Anthropologist analyses warn that human frameworks may not capture an animal’s mental “language” ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-025-00828-z#:~:text=Before%20turning%20to%20the%20ethical,11)); forcing a human-centric translation could distort meaning.  There is also risk of psychological harm: broadcasting AI-mimicked whale sounds, for example, could disrupt natural whale behavior.  A review of AI-whale experiments highlights issues like privacy (disturbing animals), cultural harm (mixing up dialects), and “technological solutionism” (overreliance on tech instead of habitat protection) ([gizmodo.com](https://gizmodo.com/ai-is-deciphering-animal-speech-should-we-try-to-talk-back-2000598783#:~:text=A%20recent%20paper%20on%20the,are%20already%20under%20serious%20threat)).  In this quadrant, both stakes are high: success could change humanity’s place in nature, but failure or misuse could severely backfire.

- **Low Opportunity / Low Risk:** *Entertainment and Toy Applications.* Simple apps or devices that offer “pet translation” for novelty have limited upside but also cause little harm.  Examples include smartphone apps that label generic cat meows or bark classifiers for pet owners.  These amusements do not fundamentally advance science nor significantly affect animals, so their opportunity (insight or welfare gain) is low.  They carry low risk as well, except perhaps trivial privacy concerns (recording pet sounds).  If these remain gimmicks, they inhabit the “toy” space: minor educational value, low consequence.

- **Low Opportunity / High Risk:** *Misguided or Exploitative Uses.* This quadrant includes scenarios where promise is overstated or misapplied.  For instance, using AI-vocal analysis to secretly optimize animal exploitation in factory farming (e.g. by manipulating behaviors for higher yield) would be ethically problematic ([resources.aiforanimals.org](https://resources.aiforanimals.org/ai-for-animals-wiki/using-ai-to-decipher-animal-communication#:~:text=rights%20arguments,efficiency%2C%20is%20also%20a%20concern)).  Likewise, if investors rush “talking animal” startups for hype, substantial resources could be wasted on pseudoscience.  Poorly validated models might mislead non-experts (e.g. mis-classifying an ape’s alarm call as routine, leading to ignored dangers).  Some analysts fear that, without caution, we could violate animal autonomy or privacy or inadvertently “speak over” animals rather than help them.  In this zone, the net “return” is negative: high downside (ethical breach, lost trust, harmed animals) and little genuine benefit.

## 5. Scenarios (2030–2040)  
To explore possible futures, we consider three illustrative scenarios for AI animal communication. Each blends uncertainties in technology, governance and societal values:

- **Scenario 1: *Symbiotic Coexistence*** – *“Animals as Partners”*  
  In this optimistic future, interdisciplinary collaboration and ethical guidelines prevail. AI tools become part of conservation and care in regulated, intentional ways.  Veterinarians routinely use AI assistants that decode subtle animal cues (body language, sounds) to diagnose illness earlier, boosting animal health.  Conservationists and authorities adopt sensor networks and AI translators to create dynamic wildlife protection (e.g. ships automatically reroute when whale signals indicate nearby feeding). Critically, legal systems begin to accept animal “testimony” as evidence: for instance, whales could “verbalize” how noise pollution affects them, and courts incorporate this data into marine protection laws.  Driven by ESP and MOTH-style initiatives ([atmos.earth](https://atmos.earth/using-ai-to-decode-animal-communication/#:~:text=terms%20have%20to%20do%20with,right%20to%20safety%20and%20wellbeing)) ([sentientmedia.org](https://sentientmedia.org/ai-animal-communication-breakthroughs/#:~:text=Increasing%20our%20understanding%20of%20animal,increase%20our%20empathy%20towards%20them)), policy reform grants animals stronger rights (not full personhood, but safeguards informed by their communications). Public empathy surges as people hear condensed animal “stories” about habitat loss and climate stress, fueling stronger environmental action. International frameworks emerge (akin to climate accords) that formally consider wildlife voices in resource planning. Overall, technology serves the animals’ interests: progress is slow but steady, with transparent oversight.  

  *Uncertainties:* This scenario hinges on AI achieving sufficiently accurate decoding of key signals (a high bar) and on sustained political will to treat animals as communicative stakeholders. If either falters, the transformative social vision could remain out of reach.

- **Scenario 2: *Techno-Commercial Boom*** – *“Pet Pundits and Boardroom Beasts”*  
  Here, the market and defense sectors drive rapid but fragmented development. Early successes (e.g. Baidu’s “cat translator” patent ([gizmodo.com](https://gizmodo.com/ai-is-deciphering-animal-speech-should-we-try-to-talk-back-2000598783#:~:text=Private%20companies%20,pet%20was%20trying%20to%20convey))) spin out consumer gadgets: smart collars that claim to translate pet emotions, farm equipment that interprets livestock distress to optimize productivity, even AI-entertainment services (zoos with “interpreter kiosks”). Major tech companies compete to mass-produce AI-animal interfaces. In parallel, biosecurity agencies employ AI translations to monitor disease vectors (e.g. decoding bat or pig sounds for warning signs). Profit motives overshadow caution: companies aggressively refine models to win the pet care market.  

  **Outcomes:** Tens of millions of pet owners buy “doggy translator” apps, though most simply categorize basic states (hunger, anxiety) rather than full language. Farmers use vocal AI to squeeze efficiency from livestock: for instance, responding to animal discomfort within seconds to keep yield up (with ambiguous effect on welfare). Conservation gains are incidental: data from these products end up in research registers (for example, a startup shares anonymized data that helps ecologists track urban wildlife). However, risks mount. There are high-profile mishaps: inaccurate “translations” go viral (e.g. a social platform builds a narrative around a mistranslated elephant cue), creating public alarm or backlash. Ethicists accuse companies of “technological solutionism” ([gizmodo.com](https://gizmodo.com/ai-is-deciphering-animal-speech-should-we-try-to-talk-back-2000598783#:~:text=A%20recent%20paper%20on%20the,are%20already%20under%20serious%20threat)) – using tech fixes while ignoring root problems like habitat loss. Debates explode: should we let corporations “own” animal communications? By 2040, governments finally step in with partial regulations (e.g. banning invasive devices), but only after a decade of largely unregulated commercialization. 

  *Uncertainties:* The pace of corporate R&D and consumer adoption is unpredictable. If tech underdelivers (i.e. fails to convincingly decode meaningful signals), this boom may fizzle into mere pet-tech novelty. Conversely, if breakthroughs happen unexpectedly (e.g. a startup cracks primate semantics), the field could surge far faster than forecast. 

- **Scenario 3: *Cautious Regulation*** – *“The Echo Chamber”*  
  In this intermediate future, progress is deliberate and heavily overseen. Early excitement is tempered by scientific and ethical caution. Researchers repeatedly emphasize that AI provides *suggestions* not certainties – e.g. “meaning comes only with behavioral context” ([gizmodo.com](https://gizmodo.com/ai-is-deciphering-animal-speech-should-we-try-to-talk-back-2000598783#:~:text=familiarity%20and%20the%20public%E2%80%99s%20perception,these%20tools%20can%20be%20applied)). Large-scale translation remains elusive; instead, projects focus on very narrow use-cases (e.g. understanding alarm calls in a single species) where humans can validate interpretations. Legislative bodies draft new rules on interspecies AI, requiring any “animal talk” technology to meet strict welfare standards (inspired by ESP’s own principles ([www.weforum.org](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/01/how-artificial-intelligence-is-getting-us-closer-to-talking-to-animals/#:~:text=Researchers%20are%20taking%20steps%20to,supports%20conservation%20and%20animal%20wellbeing))). As a result, most applications stay within research and public-sector use.  

  **Outcomes:** By 2035, we have reliable AI systems for passive monitoring (e.g. tracking migration via calls) and for welfare spotting (e.g. identifying distress in poultry houses). Pet-relay devices exist but are marketed explicitly for owners to observe your pet’s cues, not to claim full translation. No general “Google Translate for animals” emerges. Ethical allowances are often needed: for example, playing AI-generated whale sounds to marine animals is either banned or very tightly controlled due to fears of disrupting pod culture. Public discourse remains divided. Skeptics cite Nagel/Wittgenstein-style arguments (see AI&Ethics ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-025-00828-z#:~:text=Before%20turning%20to%20the%20ethical,11))) that we may never truly *understand* animals’ subjective experiences, and so caution prevails. 

  *Uncertainties:* This scenario depends on continued scientific modesty and foresight. If research unexpectedly yields clear communicative signals (e.g. discovering a finite “lexicon” in an animal species), it could break through the cautious trend. Conversely, high-profile failures (e.g. an infamous mis-translation incident) could push us sharply into this slow-progress regime. 

## 6. Strategic Implications  
Regardless of which future emerges, stakeholders should prepare now by balancing innovation with responsibility:

- **Conservation Organizations & Ecologists:**  AI-based monitoring tools will soon be indispensable. Wildlife agencies should invest in acoustic sensor networks and partner with AI experts (as Canada’s DFO did with Google for orca detection ([research.google](https://research.google/blog/whistles-songs-boings-and-biotwangs-recognizing-whale-vocalizations-with-ai/#:~:text=Google%20Research%E2%80%99s%20journey%20with%20whale,collaboration%20with%20Google%20Creative%20Lab))). Data-sharing agreements (e.g. contributing recordings to open benchmarks) can accelerate algorithm development. At the same time, conservationists must advocate for animal benefits – for example, insisting any translation tech be used to reduce human disturbance.

- **Agricultural Producers & Veterinarians:**  Livestock interests may gain new welfare diagnostics (via voice or behavior AI). Firms should pilot these tools but under ethical oversight – e.g. using vocalization analysis to detect pain and then immediately alleviating it, rather than solely to boost output. The EPFL SuperAnimal model ([actu.epfl.ch](https://actu.epfl.ch/news/unifying-behavioral-analysis-through-animal-foun-5#:~:text=These%20advances%20will%20make%20motion,AmadeusGPT%2C%20published%20recently%20at%20NeurIPS)) suggests vets could soon get automated alerts to gait changes in a horse or a pain grimace in a cow. Producers should collaborate with ethicists and animal scientists to ensure use-cases are humane. Done right, farms could leverage this for both better welfare certifications and productivity.

- **Tech Companies & AI Developers:**  The interspecies communication field is an emerging market. Companies should pursue R&D partnerships (e.g. Google’s work on whales ([research.google](https://research.google/blog/whistles-songs-boings-and-biotwangs-recognizing-whale-vocalizations-with-ai/#:~:text=We%20introduce%20our%20new%20whale,attributed%20to%20the%20Bryde%E2%80%99s%20whale)), partnerships like Google–Wild Dolphin Project ([gizmodo.com](https://gizmodo.com/ai-is-deciphering-animal-speech-should-we-try-to-talk-back-2000598783#:~:text=Meanwhile%2C%20Google%20and%20the%20Wild,groundwork%20for%20future%20interspecies%20dialogue)), or EPFL’s open SuperAnimal code). They must also heed “AI Principles”: for each product, evaluate the impact on animal welfare and privacy. Following lessons from AI ethics, firms should include biologists and ethicists on their teams (as one expert recommends merging ML and animal behavior knowledge ([gizmodo.com](https://gizmodo.com/ai-is-deciphering-animal-speech-should-we-try-to-talk-back-2000598783#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWhat%20we%20desperately%20need%E2%80%94apart%20from,%E2%80%9D))). Open-sourcing tools and following ESP’s example of publishing benchmark data ([www.weforum.org](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/01/how-artificial-intelligence-is-getting-us-closer-to-talking-to-animals/#:~:text=bioacoustics%2C%20the%20recording%20of%20individual,learning%20classification%20and%20detection%20performance))can build trust. 

- **Policymakers & Regulators:**  Governments should start devising guidelines now. Open initiatives like NYU’s MOTH project ([atmos.earth](https://atmos.earth/using-ai-to-decode-animal-communication/#:~:text=advance%20rights%20for%20humans%2C%20non,well%20as%20from%20adjacent%20fields)) illustrate how law and tech can intersect; similar interagency task forces could set standards for animal-communication AI. For instance, rules might require demonstrating that any “talking” devices do no harm (e.g. not causing stress via playback). Environmental regulators can incorporate sound-based monitoring into conservation planning (as in the US West Coast “mobile marine protected areas” project ([www.weforum.org](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/01/how-artificial-intelligence-is-getting-us-closer-to-talking-to-animals/#:~:text=AI%20analysis%20of%20animal%20communication,coalitions%20between%20animals%20and%20ships))). Over the longer term, legislators and the judiciary should consider whether decoded animal messages warrant legal status – e.g. should a clear distress signal from a zoo elephant have the same weight as seen-acts of cruelty in court ([atmos.earth](https://atmos.earth/using-ai-to-decode-animal-communication/#:~:text=Decoding%20animal%20communication%20could%20also,animal%20communication%20would%20be%20a))?

- **Research Institutions & Funders:**  Support for interdisciplinary research will be key. Funding agencies should continue backing both technical work and ethical studies: for example, a fitted grant could require a team of ML engineers, ethologists and philosophers. As Christian Rutz and others urge ([gizmodo.com](https://gizmodo.com/ai-is-deciphering-animal-speech-should-we-try-to-talk-back-2000598783#:~:text=%E2%80%9CI%20think%20there%E2%80%99s%20currently%20a,%E2%80%9D)) ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-025-00828-z#:~:text=confers%20moral%20standing%20or%20merely,to%20what%20was%20already%20there)), any AI project must tie vocal signals back to observable behavior data to ensure validity. Likewise, funders should encourage transparency (open data, reproducibility). Initiatives like the Coller-Dolittle challenge ([sentientmedia.org](https://sentientmedia.org/ai-animal-communication-breakthroughs/#:~:text=Some%20foundations%20are%20betting%20money,the%20code%E2%80%9D%20on%20animal%20communication)) model how to stimulate breakthrough thinking, but must be paired with careful ethical review panels.

- **Public & Educational Outreach:**  Finally, society at large needs education. Misconceptions (e.g. that AI will instantly give animals human-like language) should be addressed. Outreach by science communicators and NGOs can present balanced views – neither hyperbolic “ChatGPT for whales” nor nihilistic skepticism. This helps manage expectations and prepares citizens to engage in debates (for instance, whether animal communications should influence dietary or conservation choices). In the long run, as one ethicist notes, giving animals a voice may simply sound a reminder: “we’re making cool discoveries…but ultimately we’re finding that other species are just as complicated and nuanced as we are” ([gizmodo.com](https://gizmodo.com/ai-is-deciphering-animal-speech-should-we-try-to-talk-back-2000598783#:~:text=%E2%80%9CA%20big%20part%20of%20our,%E2%80%9D)). Strategy should thus aim to temper hubris with humility, ensuring that “what we hear” leads to enlightened action rather than complacent self-interest. 

In summary, AI-enabled animal communication is poised to be a disruptive frontier. Most likely the next two decades will see steady research progress, accompanied by public fascination and cautionary debate.   For stakeholders (conservationists, tech firms, policymakers, farmers, etc.), the strategic imperative is clear: engage proactively now, shape the technology with ethics in mind, and be ready to integrate a possible “voice” of animals into decision-making. As one review cautions, true co-existence will require not only “transformative insights” from AI, but also “immediate development of ethical guidelines and robust legislative frameworks” ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-025-00828-z#:~:text=confers%20moral%20standing%20or%20merely,to%20what%20was%20already%20there)).
