For industry, they include initiatives that increase organizational capabilities. For academia, they include activities that generate knowledge and make a defined contribution to society. * Collaborative projects are most likely to be successful if partners track their initial inputs, take specific steps to bring about transformations, and aim to achieve desired outputs. * Partners can both predict and exploit the outcomes of their collaborations if they understand how their existing capabilities could be extended and enhanced by the mutual exchange of knowledge. Collaborations between universities and businesses have accelerated in the past few years, especially in the areas of innovation, technology transfer, strategy, and policy deployment.

        "description": "\nScenario planning is a process [pioneered\n by the U.S. military](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR2173z1.html) , which today runs exercises looking up to 20 years out to guide\n R&D efforts. ## Why Is Scenario Planning Important? Scenario planning can provide a competitive advantage by enabling leaders to react quickly\n and decisively \u2014 because a situation has been thought through and actions documented,\n no one has to scramble when in the midst of a crisis. Scenario planning also gives executives and boards of directors a framework to make\n nonemergency decisions more effectively by providing insight into plans, budgets and\n forecasts and painting a clearer picture of key [drivers for\n business growth](/portal/resource/articles/financial-management/the-key-drivers-and-challenges-to-international-growth-a-finance-teams-perspective.shtml) and the potential impact of future events. ### Scenario Planning Advantages and Disadvantages\n\nA comprehensive scenario planning exercise takes time, effort and money. Should you commit? ### _Advantages:_\n\n* Scenario planning will help executives understand the effects of various plausible\n   events. * Finance, operations and other teams can prepare initial responses. * There's an element of knowledge management; by having key\n   personnel take part, the company captures their insights and recommendations. * If these stakeholders are unavailable during an actual extreme event, the company has\n   documentation to fall back on.\n ... \n* \n  ### Normative scenarios\n  \n  \n  \n  These describe a preferred or achievable end state. These scenarios are less\n   objective planning and more geared toward statements of goals. These goals are not\n   necessarily about an organizational vision, but more about how the company would\n   like to operate in the future. Normative scenarios are often combined with other\n   types of scenario planning as they provide a summation of changes and a targeted\n   list of activities. * \n  ### Strategic management scenarios\n  \n  \n  \n  Essentially stories that say little about the company or industry, but more about\n   the environment in which products and services are consumed. These are often the\n   most challenging scenarios for company leaders to put together because they require\n   a broad industry, economic and world view. On the plus side, they give planners\n   freedom to brainstorm decisions and a broad storytelling mandate. In some cases,\n   companies bring in analysts or [even so-called futurists (opens in new tab)](https://www.technologyreview.com/2016/12/28/243894/how-to-think-like-a-futurist/) . ## How to Use Scenario Planning\n\nTypically, macroeconomic expectations are used in conjunction with scenario planning to help\n the CFO frame near-term expectations for the company and to level-set expectations in\n departments. The fundamentals of scenario planning are the same, even if the particulars across industries\n and within businesses vary.",

Unlike traditional planning, strategic foresight does not assume stability. It considers disruptions, new trends, and technological advancements that could reshape industries. By applying foresight systematically, organizations gain insight into potential risks and opportunities before they emerge. ### How strategic foresight differs from traditional forecasting\n\nTraditional forecasting relies on past data to predict what is likely to happen. It assumes that historical patterns will continue, making it useful for short-term planning. However, this approach often fails when dealing with high uncertainty or unprecedented shifts in the world. Strategic foresight, on the other hand, embraces uncertainty. It explores multiple trend developments, allowing organizations to assess the importance of each trend relative to their strategies continuously.\n ... \nThis minimizes uncertainty and reduces the risk of being caught off guard by transformational shifts in their industry. ### Scenario planning: How do key drivers of change influence future-ready business strategies\n\nScenario planning is a traditional tool in strategic foresight that prepares for multiple possible future developments. Instead of relying on a single forecast, organizations create different plausible scenarios based on key drivers of change. These scenarios consider how factors like new technologies, geopolitical events, or climate policies might develop. For each factor, different projections are created. The likelihood of co-occurrence of these projections is calculated and leads to different consistent scenarios. In explorative scenario planning, organizations then develop response actions for each scenario, ensuring that they can adapt quickly when changes occur. It is yet worth noting that scenario analysis has lost relevance over the years due to a lack of direct impact on problem-solving, creation effort, and the rise of AI foresight tools. ### Business opportunity development: From trends to fields of action\n\nTo make foresight effective, all the collected foresight intelligence needs to result in a clear presentation of [potential opportunities](/environmental-scanning) to increase market share, and profitability, or create new profit for the leadership team.",

Scenario planning is a method of forecasting and [analysis](/blog/what-is-financial-planning-analysis-fpa-software) that takes a variety of assumptions to drive different outcomes in the future. This planning method can be traced back to the days of the Cold War when analysts used existing information to predict how nuclear war could play out to manage uncertainties better. Though nuclear war could be considered an extreme scenario, a global pandemic has done just that, reminding finance and business leaders of the importance of planning for the unknown.

It involves examining multiple potential futures and creating and comparing scenarios considering business revenue over time.\n ... \n## **Types of scenario planning**\n\nFP&A professionals use multiple types of strategy planning to analyze and prepare for a wide range of potential future scenarios. Let's examine four common types of scenario planning, each designed for a specific purpose and providing essential tools for informed decision-making in a rapidly changing environment. ### Quantitative scenarios\n\nThese scenarios are based on financial models, presenting both the best and worst possible outcomes. They allow for quick adjustments by changing key variables and are commonly used for annual business forecasts. Quantitative scenarios help businesses put a value on possible risks so they can plan financially for any unforeseen events. ### Operational scenarios\n\nOperational scenarios are what-if situations that organizations use to prepare for events or crises that may affect their current operations. Basically, these scenarios focus on an event's immediate impact. They help organizations explore short-term [operational plans](/blog/operational-planning-vs-strategic-planning) and strategic implications and responses to specific situations. ### Normative scenarios\n\nNormative scenarios describe a preferred or achievable end state, emphasizing goals and how the company envisions operating in the future. In addition to outlining future organizational performance, normative scenarios enable organizations to develop roadmaps to achieving their goals.",

Strategic planning tools empower businesses to stay on top of these trends and make a lasting impact in their industries. Build your strategy for the future by evaluating these trends. 1.\nResilience Planning\nThe last few years have come with extreme ups and downs. Economy shifts and market changes have significantly impacted new and established companies. Neglecting the importance of confronting unforeseen circumstances is one of the most\u00a0 common strategic planning failures . Businesses can gain confidence moving forward with resilience planning. Resilience planning involves creating initiatives to expand business continuity during uncertain times. It\u00a0 comes with many advantages , such as fostering a more collaborative environment and enhancing visibility. The key to maintaining a resilient organization is developing unique approaches that enable flexibility and responsiveness. In any fast-changing environment, there\u2019s always a need to consider \u201cwhat if\u201d scenarios. During unpredictable changes or volatile market fluctuations, your strategy and execution should be able to assess, adapt and realign your resources as needed. Implementing new tools for strategic planning can enhance your approach\u2019s overall effectiveness. Your future strategy should include tools to prevent or minimize the effects of cyberattacks, global pandemics, war, economic downturns, environmental events and the disruptions of a new competitor. 2. Collaboration\nStrategic planning means little if your departments and teams operate separately. Cross-functional teams are essential for bringing your organization together and driving progress.",

        "description": "\n[Explore scenario planning with SAP](//www.sap.com/products/financial-management/financial-planning-analysis-fpa.html)\n\n## Scenario planning meaning and definition\n\nScenario planning looks at different future scenarios and considers varied combinations of assumptions and events. These scenarios are not predictions or forecasts but alternative views of how the future could unfold. By analyzing these scenarios, organizations can anticipate potential challenges and opportunities, helping them to react effectively as events unfold. Developed initially for military strategies and later embraced by the corporate world, scenario planning is beneficial in uncertain, complex, or rapidly changing environments. It allows organizations to test strategies against possible future states, understand the impacts of recent decisions, and increase their preparedness for unexpected events. Essentially, scenario planning shifts the focus from trying to predict the future to understanding the dynamics that will shape it. ## Why is scenario planning important? In an ever-evolving global landscape, uncertainties abound. Whether they be geopolitical changes, market fluctuations, or technological advancements, these uncertainties can significantly impact an organization\u2019s future. Scenario planning is essential as it helps organizations to navigate these uncertainties by envisaging various outcomes and preparing strategies accordingly.\n ... \n* \n  **Agent-based modeling:** This technique is used for simulating interactions of autonomous agents (e.g., consumers, companies) to assess their effects on the system as a whole. ##### Data visualization\n\nData visualization tools are crucial for effectively communicating the outcomes of scenario analysis. These tools help in creating graphs, charts, and other visual aids to represent data in an easily digestible form. By visually representing the data, organizations can better understand the trends and patterns that emerge from the scenario analysis. Combining scenario building, simulation models, and data visualization tools in scenario planning can provide organizations with a more comprehensive, informed, and visual representation of potential future states. This, in turn, supports more robust [strategic planning](//www.sap.com/products/financial-management/what-is-financial-planning-and-analysis-fpa.html) and decision-making processes. * * *\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe rapidly changing business environment and the unpredictability of markets make it more important than ever for organizations to be prepared for various eventualities. Scenario planning stands as a critical strategic tool that enables businesses to navigate the murky waters of uncertainty by envisaging multiple future states. Scenario planning holds the power to transform organizations by instilling a culture of strategic thinking and adaptability.",

It\u2019s easier to find useful patterns if you have a lot of data to learn from . Easy access to massive amounts of data on the Internet is part of the reason why artificial intelligence has gotten so much better in recent years. Researchers are also figuring out how to write better software that can find more complex, useful patterns in the data that we have. With rapidly improving algorithms and an abundance of data, we seem to have reached a tipping point in the last few years where powerful new AI tools have become possible, taking the world by storm with their surprising usefulness. It turns out these same approaches can be applied to animal communication, too. The Rise of AI in Animal Communication Research\nAnimals, including human animals, make noises and body expressions that are all just different types of data \u2014 audio data, visual data and even pheromone data .

        "description": "Last updated: Nov 18, 2024\nDesigned to mimic the structure and function of biological neural networks, these sensors process information in ways that are eerily similar to the human brain. The result? Sensors that can learn, adapt, and make decisions on the fly. Neuromorphic sensors are expected to play an increasingly important role in advanced AI systems, potentially enabling more efficient and intelligent data processing at the edge. While not strictly a sensor, BrainChip's [Akida neural network processor chip](https://brainchip.com/akida-neural-processor-soc/) can be integrated with various sensors to enable neuromorphic processing of sensor data. Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) sensors have been around for a while, but they're about to get a serious upgrade. In 2025, we expect to see MEMS sensors that are smaller, more precise, and capable of measuring a wider range of physical phenomena. These tiny titans will enable next-gen IoT devices, from ultra-sensitive accelerometers that can detect the slightest movements to miniature spectrometers that can analyze chemical compositions. [Bosch's Sensortec BMI270](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/products/motion-sensors/imus/bmi270/) high-performance IMU, for example, combines a MEMS accelerometer and a MEMS gyroscope in one tiny package, making it ideal for wearables and IoT devices.

Advances in materials science, particularly through nanotechnology, will enable sensors to detect the most subtle changes in environmental or biological conditions. <sup>2</sup>\n\nNanoscale materials, known for their unique properties, will enhance sensors' ability to identify minute variations, leading to earlier and more accurate diagnoses in healthcare. These improvements will extend beyond medicine, revolutionizing environmental monitoring by detecting trace pollutants and changes in atmospheric conditions, thus facilitating more effective interventions. In industrial settings, heightened precision will elevate process monitoring, improving quality control and operational efficiency.\n ... \n<sup>5</sup>\n\nIn a recent study published in [_Advanced Materials Technologies_](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/admt.202101034) , researchers created a 3D-printed biocompatible sensor that can be smoothly incorporated into wearable devices for ongoing health monitoring. These sensors are crafted from stretchable, skin-like materials that adapt to the body, delivering precise measurements of essential signs like heart rate, blood pressure, and glucose levels. This study marks a noteworthy advancement in the progression of next-generation wearable health technologies. <sup>8</sup>\n\nThe potential uses of biocompatible sensors are extensive, especially in healthcare. Wearable health technologies, such as smartwatches and fitness trackers, will benefit from these advancements, offering more accurate and comprehensive monitoring of vital signs. Furthermore, implantable devices designed to monitor chronic conditions or deliver targeted treatments will also improve functionality and patient comfort. ### AI-Powered Sensor Networks\n\nThe fusion of AI with sensor technology will give rise to intelligent sensor networks by 2030. These networks will be capable of autonomous decision-making, optimizing data collection, analysis, and response without human intervention. AI-powered sensors will not only acquire data but also process and interpret it locally, decreasing latency and enabling quicker, more precise real-time decision-making.",

        "description": "Last updated: Dec 23, 2024\nBecause law is created and enforced by recognized authorities, it holds the power to compel individuals and organizations to conform to specific rules. In legal terms, laws are valid regardless of ethics, including individual beliefs or moral perspectives. Ethics stem from cultural norms and/or religious beliefs. Ethics does not depend on formal institutions for validation \u2013 ethics are based on individual and collective moral judgments and are not enforced by the political power of the government that compels obedience. Aristotle highlighted this distinction, noting that ethics is a \u201creasoned choice\u201d rather than a mandated obligation. When Aristotle defined the purpose of law, he emphasized its role in regulating behavior and maintaining public order. Aristotle referred to the Politeia (political community) and how law serves a practical, utilitarian function in governance. Aristotle also explained there is room in the legal system to ensure justice. While the legal system often reflects societal values, it primarily seeks to govern interactions among individuals and groups. The function of law is primarily external, as it governs actions rather than internal motivations. An ethical obligation, in other words, might be reflected in legal rules, but not all wrong actions are illegal by definition. New legislation does not always deal with ethical issues and will not always follow moral standards, since public order and regulation of behavior outweigh normative ethics.\n ... \nSome speech most Americans regard as \u201cwrong\u201d are, nonetheless, protected by the U.S. Constitution. The government is expected to allow this speech as part of the free exchange of ideas that allows for differences, even when the majority finds the speech reprehensible and wrong. Aristotle\u2019s advocacy for moderation \u2013 \u201cAnyone can become angry\u2026 but to be angry with the right person, to the right degree, at the right time, for the right purpose, and in the right way\u201d \u2013 suggests that ethical speech involves responsible expression, even in contexts where law may permit harmful language. Aristotle would say the solution to speech lacking integrity isn\u2019t more regulations but creating a conversation focused on ethics and principles, helping people see the difference between right and wrong. The difference between ethics and the law is not a problem of just one country; it is part of any political system. It is essential for every law student to understand the intricate relationship between law and ethics and understand the difference between legal and ethical behavior.",

Or a member of the public complaining that staff (or a council/board member, or the chief executive) was rude to them, did not respond to them, or otherwise treated them in a way that the person thought was inappropriate. ## Law vs. Ethics\n\nThese questions often have two components: 1) What is the legal authority for \u201cthat\u201d and 2) \u201cshould\u201d the person/agency/body do \u201cthat.\u201d Retired MRSC Legal Consultant Jim Doherty once wrote on this topic, noting:\n\n> Actions are \u201clegal\u201d if they do not violate the laws or codes of the local government, state, or federal government. Actions are \u2018ethical\u2019 or \u2018moral\u2019 (I will treat the words as synonymous in this article) if they meet an individual\u2019s personal code of conduct, which may be based on a particular social, religious, or other group norms. \u201cLegal\u201d is easy; \u201cEthics\u201d is not.\n ... \nThe agency will also have to remember that its officials and employees do not lose their First Amendment rights merely because they now work for a government agency. MRSC has written extensively about this issue as well (see [Adverse Employment Action for Employee Social Media Use: Balancing First Amendment Rights and Governmental Efficiency](https://mrsc.org/stay-informed/mrsc-insight/march-2022/adverse-employment-action-for-employee-social-medi) , [Political Speech and Lobbying by Local Government Employees: What are the Rules of Engagement? ](https://mrsc.org/stay-informed/mrsc-insight/april-2017/political-speech-and-lobbying-by-local-government) )\n\nWe\u2019ve also covered how members of the public have First Amendment rights when addressing their elected officials or interacting with staff (see [When First Amendment Rights and Public Meetings Clash](https://mrsc.org/stay-informed/mrsc-insight/july-2020/when-1st-amendment-rights-public-meetings-clash) , [Rights and Limits on Filming in Public Facilities](https://mrsc.org/stay-informed/mrsc-insight/april-2023/rights-and-limits-on-filming-in-public-facilities) ). ### So, do you have an answer for us or not? Not. All these options lead right back to the problem of what are \u201cprinciples of right behavior\u201d and what are the bases for those principles?

What's important is choosing a method that works for your team\n* We'll look at two fictional firms, a software company and a wholesale distributor,\n   to illustrate the planning process\n\nIf anything magnifies the value of scenario planning, it's a pandemic \u2014 even if\n most companies didn't have \u201ceconomy grinds to a halt\u201d in their modeling.

Unlike traditional planning, strategic foresight does not assume stability. It considers disruptions, new trends, and technological advancements that could reshape industries. By applying foresight systematically, organizations gain insight into potential risks and opportunities before they emerge. ### How strategic foresight differs from traditional forecasting\n\nTraditional forecasting relies on past data to predict what is likely to happen. It assumes that historical patterns will continue, making it useful for short-term planning. However, this approach often fails when dealing with high uncertainty or unprecedented shifts in the world. Strategic foresight, on the other hand, embraces uncertainty. It explores multiple trend developments, allowing organizations to assess the importance of each trend relative to their strategies continuously.\n ... \nThis minimizes uncertainty and reduces the risk of being caught off guard by transformational shifts in their industry. ### Scenario planning: How do key drivers of change influence future-ready business strategies\n\nScenario planning is a traditional tool in strategic foresight that prepares for multiple possible future developments. Instead of relying on a single forecast, organizations create different plausible scenarios based on key drivers of change. These scenarios consider how factors like new technologies, geopolitical events, or climate policies might develop. For each factor, different projections are created. The likelihood of co-occurrence of these projections is calculated and leads to different consistent scenarios. In explorative scenario planning, organizations then develop response actions for each scenario, ensuring that they can adapt quickly when changes occur. It is yet worth noting that scenario analysis has lost relevance over the years due to a lack of direct impact on problem-solving, creation effort, and the rise of AI foresight tools. ### Business opportunity development: From trends to fields of action\n\nTo make foresight effective, all the collected foresight intelligence needs to result in a clear presentation of [potential opportunities](/environmental-scanning) to increase market share, and profitability, or create new profit for the leadership team.",

Scenario planning is a method of forecasting and [analysis](/blog/what-is-financial-planning-analysis-fpa-software) that takes a variety of assumptions to drive different outcomes in the future. This planning method can be traced back to the days of the Cold War when analysts used existing information to predict how nuclear war could play out to manage uncertainties better. Though nuclear war could be considered an extreme scenario, a global pandemic has done just that, reminding finance and business leaders of the importance of planning for the unknown.

It involves examining multiple potential futures and creating and comparing scenarios considering business revenue over time.\n ... \n## **Types of scenario planning**\n\nFP&A professionals use multiple types of strategy planning to analyze and prepare for a wide range of potential future scenarios. Let's examine four common types of scenario planning, each designed for a specific purpose and providing essential tools for informed decision-making in a rapidly changing environment. ### Quantitative scenarios\n\nThese scenarios are based on financial models, presenting both the best and worst possible outcomes. They allow for quick adjustments by changing key variables and are commonly used for annual business forecasts. Quantitative scenarios help businesses put a value on possible risks so they can plan financially for any unforeseen events. ### Operational scenarios\n\nOperational scenarios are what-if situations that organizations use to prepare for events or crises that may affect their current operations. Basically, these scenarios focus on an event's immediate impact. They help organizations explore short-term [operational plans](/blog/operational-planning-vs-strategic-planning) and strategic implications and responses to specific situations. ### Normative scenarios\n\nNormative scenarios describe a preferred or achievable end state, emphasizing goals and how the company envisions operating in the future. In addition to outlining future organizational performance, normative scenarios enable organizations to develop roadmaps to achieving their goals.",

Strategic planning tools empower businesses to stay on top of these trends and make a lasting impact in their industries. Build your strategy for the future by evaluating these trends. 1.\nResilience Planning\nThe last few years have come with extreme ups and downs. Economy shifts and market changes have significantly impacted new and established companies. Neglecting the importance of confronting unforeseen circumstances is one of the most\u00a0 common strategic planning failures . Businesses can gain confidence moving forward with resilience planning. Resilience planning involves creating initiatives to expand business continuity during uncertain times. It\u00a0 comes with many advantages , such as fostering a more collaborative environment and enhancing visibility. The key to maintaining a resilient organization is developing unique approaches that enable flexibility and responsiveness. In any fast-changing environment, there\u2019s always a need to consider \u201cwhat if\u201d scenarios. During unpredictable changes or volatile market fluctuations, your strategy and execution should be able to assess, adapt and realign your resources as needed. Implementing new tools for strategic planning can enhance your approach\u2019s overall effectiveness. Your future strategy should include tools to prevent or minimize the effects of cyberattacks, global pandemics, war, economic downturns, environmental events and the disruptions of a new competitor. 2. Collaboration\nStrategic planning means little if your departments and teams operate separately. Cross-functional teams are essential for bringing your organization together and driving progress.",

        "description": "\n[Explore scenario planning with SAP](//www.sap.com/products/financial-management/financial-planning-analysis-fpa.html)\n\n## Scenario planning meaning and definition\n\nScenario planning looks at different future scenarios and considers varied combinations of assumptions and events. These scenarios are not predictions or forecasts but alternative views of how the future could unfold. By analyzing these scenarios, organizations can anticipate potential challenges and opportunities, helping them to react effectively as events unfold. Developed initially for military strategies and later embraced by the corporate world, scenario planning is beneficial in uncertain, complex, or rapidly changing environments. It allows organizations to test strategies against possible future states, understand the impacts of recent decisions, and increase their preparedness for unexpected events. Essentially, scenario planning shifts the focus from trying to predict the future to understanding the dynamics that will shape it. ## Why is scenario planning important? In an ever-evolving global landscape, uncertainties abound. Whether they be geopolitical changes, market fluctuations, or technological advancements, these uncertainties can significantly impact an organization\u2019s future. Scenario planning is essential as it helps organizations to navigate these uncertainties by envisaging various outcomes and preparing strategies accordingly.\n ... \n* \n  **Agent-based modeling:** This technique is used for simulating interactions of autonomous agents (e.g., consumers, companies) to assess their effects on the system as a whole. ##### Data visualization\n\nData visualization tools are crucial for effectively communicating the outcomes of scenario analysis. These tools help in creating graphs, charts, and other visual aids to represent data in an easily digestible form. By visually representing the data, organizations can better understand the trends and patterns that emerge from the scenario analysis. Combining scenario building, simulation models, and data visualization tools in scenario planning can provide organizations with a more comprehensive, informed, and visual representation of potential future states. This, in turn, supports more robust [strategic planning](//www.sap.com/products/financial-management/what-is-financial-planning-and-analysis-fpa.html) and decision-making processes. * * *\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe rapidly changing business environment and the unpredictability of markets make it more important than ever for organizations to be prepared for various eventualities. Scenario planning stands as a critical strategic tool that enables businesses to navigate the murky waters of uncertainty by envisaging multiple future states. Scenario planning holds the power to transform organizations by instilling a culture of strategic thinking and adaptability.",

        "description": "Last updated: by R Kyerematen\nWhen an ecosystem is destroyed or degraded, its ability to sustain wildlife is compromised, and the individuals that depend on that ecosystem for survival either need to adapt or move elsewhere, or they will die. Conversely, preventing ecosystem degradation and destruction is one of the single most important actions we can take to protect biodiversity. In the process, we also improve our own well-being, given that natural ecosystems are our first line of defence against natural disasters, and provide us with food, clean water, and other ecosystem services. ! [Image](image/Fig_10.1.png)\n\nFigure 10.1 Habitat loss and degradation, much of which are driven by agriculture, are the most important threats to Africa\u2019s wildlife, followed by overharvesting, invasive species and disease, and pollution. Groups of species often face similar threats: mammals and birds are more likely to be threatened by habitat loss, while fish and molluscs are more likely to be threatened by pollution. Percentages add up to more than 100% because many species face multiple threats. The influence of climate change is under-estimated because its impact on most species still need to be assessed. Source: IUCN, 2019, CC BY 4.0. Broadly speaking, ecosystem conservation involves three different activities: (1) monitoring ecosystems, (2) maintaining ecosystems, and (3) restoring damaged ecosystems.\n ... \nBefore the turn of the 20th century, the most popular form of remote sensing was aerial photography from airplanes. These aerial photographs facilitated geographers\u2019 ability to draw maps of landscape features, including human infrastructure and natural vegetation patterns. Remote sensing opportunities greatly expanded from 1960 onward, with the launch of the National Aeronautical Space Administration\u2019s (NASA) first Earth observation satellites , to take photographs of Earth from space for weather forecasting. Subsequent satellite programmes expanded their scope to also collect additional data of Earth\u2019s surface and atmosphere. While much of this data would have been useful to conservation, early satellite data products were very expensive and thus largely out of reach of the larger conservation community. This all changed in 2008 when NASA started distributing their Earth observation products for free to the public, heralding an era in which remote sensing became a standard tool in the conservation field. Remote sensing offers a variety of tools that allow biologists to monitor biodiversity beyond the abilities of traditional field monitoring techniques. Today, hundreds of Earth observation satellites circle the planet, offering near real-time access to unbiased and consistent environmental datasets of nearly all terrestrial surfaces, oceanic surfaces and floor depths, and the atmosphere, all from the comfort of a computer connected to the internet (Wilson et al., 2013).",

Experimental and quasi-experimental methods are increasingly used to establish causal inference and build the evidence base on the effectiveness of interventions, but their ability to provide insight into how and under what conditions an intervention should be implemented to improve biodiversity outcomes faces limitations. A suite of attribution methods that leverage qualitative methods for causal inference is available but underutilized in conversation impact evaluation. This article provides a guide to 5 such qualitative attribution methods: contribution analysis, process tracing, realist evaluation, qualitative comparative analysis, and most significant change. It defines and introduces each method and then illustrates how they could be applied through a case study of community conservancies in Namibia. This guide provides examples of how qualitative attribution methods can advance knowledge of what works, in which contexts, and why in biodiversity conservation.\n ... \nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0230495\n10.1371/journal.pone.0230495\nCAS PubMed Web of Science\u00ae Google Scholar     * Collier, D.

These are exponentially increasing demand for computing power, capturing the attention of management teams and the public, and accelerating experimentation. These developments are occurring against a backdrop of rising global competition as countries and corporations race to secure leadership in producing and applying these strategic technologies.\n ... \nEven as excitement about AI applications and their use cases builds, realizing AI\u2019s full potential across sectors will require continued innovations to manage computing intensity, reduce deployment costs, and drive infrastructure investment. This will also demand thoughtful approaches to safety, governance, and workforce adaptation, creating a wide range of opportunities for industry leaders, policymakers, and entrepreneurs alike. ## New and notable\n\nIn addition to the growing reach of AI, another new trend we have chosen to highlight in this year\u2019s report is [agentic AI](/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/seizing-the-agentic-ai-advantage) , which has rapidly emerged as a major focus of interest and experimentation in enterprise and consumer technology. Agentic AI combines the flexibility and generality of AI foundation models with the ability to act in the world by creating \u201cvirtual coworkers\u201d that can autonomously plan and execute multistep workflows. Although quantitative measures of interest and equity investment levels are as yet relatively low compared with more established trends, agentic AI is among the fastest growing of this year\u2019s trends, signaling its potentially revolutionary possibilities. ##### How relevant and useful is this article for you? ### Most Popular Insights\n\n1.

Scholars are increasingly interested in the commercialization of such emerging technologies, existing studies have worked to identify the actors, dynamics, and contexts conducive to successful commercialization efforts. However, collecting and organizing the findings of these studies has been challenging as they cover a broad spectrum of technologies and have significant differences among them. To address this challenge, the present study reviews existing research on the commercialization of emerging technologies by taking the technology view, explicitly considering the technologies\u2019 shared and distinctive attributes. We have conducted a [systematic literature review](/topics/social-sciences/systematic-review \"Learn more about systematic literature review from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") covering 154 articles published in 43 journals over 28 years and structured the results around the distinct factors that allow emerging technologies to help generate innovation.

For industry, they include initiatives that increase organizational capabilities. For academia, they include activities that generate knowledge and make a defined contribution to society. * Collaborative projects are most likely to be successful if partners track their initial inputs, take specific steps to bring about transformations, and aim to achieve desired outputs. * Partners can both predict and exploit the outcomes of their collaborations if they understand how their existing capabilities could be extended and enhanced by the mutual exchange of knowledge. Collaborations between universities and businesses have accelerated in the past few years, especially in the areas of innovation, technology transfer, strategy, and policy deployment. These elements spark growth in knowledge-based economies and are increasingly important in developing countries.",

By educating, mobilizing, and empowering residents, these campaigns can address pressing social issues, influence policy reforms, and enhance disaster preparedness. This comprehensive overview explores the strategies behind successful campaigns, their broad impacts, and best practices to maximize their efficacy, illustrating their critical role in shaping healthier, safer, and more equitable communities. ## Foundations of Effective Community Awareness Campaigns\n\n! [Building the Base: Clear Goals, Culturally Tailored Messages, &amp; Community Involvement](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/679a5c424514f0813d0289ef/687ddd7191471b55a86c4c5f_d141f3d12efa4587634e7c2cbef943bc3a479a21.png)\n\n### What are some strategies and best practices for designing and evaluating community awareness campaigns? Successful community awareness campaigns are grounded in clear goal setting, targeted messaging, and the strategic use of a variety of communication channels.\n ... \nBy fostering local leadership, community campaigns generate sustainable movements that resonate with broader social and political contexts. They also strengthen community ties, amplify voices, and promote a sense of ownership and efficacy. ### Which role do arts and storytelling play in disaster response? In disaster response, arts and storytelling serve as vital tools for emotional healing, resilience-building, and raising awareness. Creative expressions help communities process trauma, share experiences, and foster solidarity. Artistic projects\u2014like memorials, murals, or performances\u2014can communicate collective grief and hope. Stories told through film, theater, or visual arts highlight community strengths and vulnerabilities, encouraging collective reflection and learning. Such initiatives also increase public awareness about risks and preparedness measures. Furthermore, incorporating arts into disaster education can make safety messages more engaging and memorable, ultimately promoting safer behaviors. These cultural expressions nurture communal bonds, which are essential during recovery and rebuilding phases. ### How does public engagement through arts and storytelling foster social cohesion? Public engagement via arts and storytelling enhances social cohesion by creating shared cultural spaces where individuals can connect, express, and understand each other's experiences. These activities foster inclusivity, reduce social divides, and build common identities.",

Let's examine four common types of scenario planning, each designed for a specific purpose and providing essential tools for informed decision-making in a rapidly changing environment. ### Quantitative scenarios\n\nThese scenarios are based on financial models, presenting both the best and worst possible outcomes.

Quantitative scenarios help businesses put a value on possible risks so they can plan financially for any unforeseen events. ### Operational scenarios\n\nOperational scenarios are what-if situations that organizations use to prepare for events or crises that may affect their current operations. Basically, these scenarios focus on an event's immediate impact.

Unlike traditional planning, strategic foresight does not assume stability. It considers disruptions, new trends, and technological advancements that could reshape industries. By applying foresight systematically, organizations gain insight into potential risks and opportunities before they emerge. ### How strategic foresight differs from traditional forecasting\n\nTraditional forecasting relies on past data to predict what is likely to happen. It assumes that historical patterns will continue, making it useful for short-term planning. However, this approach often fails when dealing with high uncertainty or unprecedented shifts in the world. Strategic foresight, on the other hand, embraces uncertainty. It explores multiple trend developments, allowing organizations to assess the importance of each trend relative to their strategies continuously.\n ... \nThis minimizes uncertainty and reduces the risk of being caught off guard by transformational shifts in their industry. ### Scenario planning: How do key drivers of change influence future-ready business strategies\n\nScenario planning is a traditional tool in strategic foresight that prepares for multiple possible future developments. Instead of relying on a single forecast, organizations create different plausible scenarios based on key drivers of change. These scenarios consider how factors like new technologies, geopolitical events, or climate policies might develop. For each factor, different projections are created. The likelihood of co-occurrence of these projections is calculated and leads to different consistent scenarios. In explorative scenario planning, organizations then develop response actions for each scenario, ensuring that they can adapt quickly when changes occur. It is yet worth noting that scenario analysis has lost relevance over the years due to a lack of direct impact on problem-solving, creation effort, and the rise of AI foresight tools. ### Business opportunity development: From trends to fields of action\n\nTo make foresight effective, all the collected foresight intelligence needs to result in a clear presentation of [potential opportunities](/environmental-scanning) to increase market share, and profitability, or create new profit for the leadership team.",

Strategic planning tools empower businesses to stay on top of these trends and make a lasting impact in their industries. Build your strategy for the future by evaluating these trends. 1.\nResilience Planning\nThe last few years have come with extreme ups and downs. Economy shifts and market changes have significantly impacted new and established companies. Neglecting the importance of confronting unforeseen circumstances is one of the most\u00a0 common strategic planning failures . Businesses can gain confidence moving forward with resilience planning. Resilience planning involves creating initiatives to expand business continuity during uncertain times. It\u00a0 comes with many advantages , such as fostering a more collaborative environment and enhancing visibility. The key to maintaining a resilient organization is developing unique approaches that enable flexibility and responsiveness. In any fast-changing environment, there\u2019s always a need to consider \u201cwhat if\u201d scenarios. During unpredictable changes or volatile market fluctuations, your strategy and execution should be able to assess, adapt and realign your resources as needed. Implementing new tools for strategic planning can enhance your approach\u2019s overall effectiveness. Your future strategy should include tools to prevent or minimize the effects of cyberattacks, global pandemics, war, economic downturns, environmental events and the disruptions of a new competitor. 2.

Some of the anticipatory methods include, the delphi method, causal layered analysis, environmental scanning, morphological analysis, and scenario planning. ## Anticipatory thinking protocols\n\n[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Futures_techniques&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: Anticipatory thinking protocols\") ]\n\n### Delphi method\n\n[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Futures_techniques&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Delphi method\") ]\n\nMain article: [Delphi method](/wiki/Delphi_method \"Delphi method\")\n\nThe Delphi method is a popular technique used in futurology. It was developed by Gordon and [Helmer](/wiki/Olaf_Helmer \"Olaf Helmer\") in 1953 at [RAND](/wiki/RAND \"RAND\") . It can be defined as a method for structuring a group communication process, so that the process is effective in allowing a group of individuals, as a whole, to deal with a complex problem.\n ... \nIt comprises the two main activities: a systematic analysis of a current and future structure of the area including the gaps in that structure, stimulation for creation of new alternative, which could fill the gaps and meet any needs. ### Scenario planning\n\n[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Futures_techniques&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit section: Scenario planning\") ]\n\nMain article: [Scenario planning](/wiki/Scenario_planning \"Scenario planning\")\n\nScenarios are one of the most popular and persuasive methods used in the Futurology. Government planners, corporate strategists and military analysts use them in order to aid decision-making. The term scenario was introduced into planning and decision-making by [Herman Kahn](/wiki/Herman_Kahn \"Herman Kahn\") in connection with military and strategic studies done by RAND in the 1950s. It can be defined as a rich and detailed portrait of a plausible future world, one sufficiently vivid that a planner can clearly see and comprehend the problems, challenges and opportunities that such an environment would present. A scenario is not a specific forecast of the future, but a plausible description of what might happen. Scenarios are like stories built around carefully constructed plots based on trends and events. They assist in selection of strategies, identification of possible futures, making people aware of uncertainties and opening up their imagination and initiating learning processes.",

Not only is this theoretically possible, but scientists are actively developing two-way communication with other animals. If we do gain this ability, it would have profound implications for animal rights , conservation and our understanding of animal sentience. Interspecies Communication Before AI\nOne definition of the word \u201ccommunication \u201d is \u201ca process by which information is exchanged between individuals through a common system of symbols, signs, or behavior.\u201d By this definition, humans have communicated with dogs for thousands of years to domesticate them.\nAnimal domestication typically requires a lot of communication \u2014 such as telling your dog to stay or roll over. Dogs can also be taught to communicate various wants and needs back to humans, such as ringing a bell when they need to go to the bathroom. In some cases, humans have already been able to have two-way communication with specific individuals using human language, such as when Koko the Gorilla learned to communicate using sign language . Grey parrots have also been shown to be able to learn and use speech at a similar level to very young children. However, two-way communication of this sort often requires a lot of work to establish. Even if one animal learns to communicate with a human, this skill does not translate to other members of that species. We might be able to communicate limited information back and forth with our companion animals or with a specific Grey parrot or chimpanzee, but that doesn\u2019t help us communicate with the multitude of squirrels, birds, fish, insects, deer and other animals roaming the world, each of whom has their own mode of communication. Given the groundswell of recent progress in artificial intelligence, could AI eventually open up two-way communication between humans and the rest of the animal kingdom? Accelerating Progress in Artificial Intelligence\nThe core idea at the heart of modern artificial intelligence is \u201cmachine learning,\u201d software that is good at finding useful patterns in data.",

Teams may propose research in a single field of study or interdisciplinary work. NEH encourages projects that incorporate multiple points of view and pursue new avenues of inquiry. Collaborators may come from one or more institutions. NEH encourages partnerships with researchers in the natural and social sciences, but projects must focus on humanistic content and employ humanistic methods. International collaboration is welcome, but scholars at U.S. institutions must contribute significantly to the project. Proposed projects must aim to result in tangible and sustainable outcomes, such as a co-authored or multi-authored book; a themed issue of a peer-reviewed journal; a series of peer-reviewed articles; a born-digital publication; or an open-access website or other digital resource. All project outcomes must incorporate collaboration and interpretation to address significant humanities research questions. The program includes four project categories: Planning International Collaboration, Convening, Manuscript Preparation, and Scholarly Digital Projects. The categories support different project types or stages and have different performance periods and award ceilings.",

Or a member of the public complaining that staff (or a council/board member, or the chief executive) was rude to them, did not respond to them, or otherwise treated them in a way that the person thought was inappropriate. ## Law vs. Ethics\n\nThese questions often have two components: 1) What is the legal authority for \u201cthat\u201d and 2) \u201cshould\u201d the person/agency/body do \u201cthat.\u201d Retired MRSC Legal Consultant Jim Doherty once wrote on this topic, noting:\n\n> Actions are \u201clegal\u201d if they do not violate the laws or codes of the local government, state, or federal government. Actions are \u2018ethical\u2019 or \u2018moral\u2019 (I will treat the words as synonymous in this article) if they meet an individual\u2019s personal code of conduct, which may be based on a particular social, religious, or other group norms. \u201cLegal\u201d is easy; \u201cEthics\u201d is not.\n ... \nThe agency will also have to remember that its officials and employees do not lose their First Amendment rights merely because they now work for a government agency. MRSC has written extensively about this issue as well (see [Adverse Employment Action for Employee Social Media Use: Balancing First Amendment Rights and Governmental Efficiency](https://mrsc.org/stay-informed/mrsc-insight/march-2022/adverse-employment-action-for-employee-social-medi) , [Political Speech and Lobbying by Local Government Employees: What are the Rules of Engagement? ](https://mrsc.org/stay-informed/mrsc-insight/april-2017/political-speech-and-lobbying-by-local-government) )\n\nWe\u2019ve also covered how members of the public have First Amendment rights when addressing their elected officials or interacting with staff (see [When First Amendment Rights and Public Meetings Clash](https://mrsc.org/stay-informed/mrsc-insight/july-2020/when-1st-amendment-rights-public-meetings-clash) , [Rights and Limits on Filming in Public Facilities](https://mrsc.org/stay-informed/mrsc-insight/april-2023/rights-and-limits-on-filming-in-public-facilities) ). ### So, do you have an answer for us or not? Not. All these options lead right back to the problem of what are \u201cprinciples of right behavior\u201d and what are the bases for those principles? A quick spin around the internet reveals an almost impossible number of sources to choose from.",

        "description": "Last updated: Dec 23, 2024\nBecause law is created and enforced by recognized authorities, it holds the power to compel individuals and organizations to conform to specific rules. In legal terms, laws are valid regardless of ethics, including individual beliefs or moral perspectives. Ethics stem from cultural norms and/or religious beliefs. Ethics does not depend on formal institutions for validation \u2013 ethics are based on individual and collective moral judgments and are not enforced by the political power of the government that compels obedience. Aristotle highlighted this distinction, noting that ethics is a \u201creasoned choice\u201d rather than a mandated obligation. When Aristotle defined the purpose of law, he emphasized its role in regulating behavior and maintaining public order. Aristotle referred to the Politeia (political community) and how law serves a practical, utilitarian function in governance. Aristotle also explained there is room in the legal system to ensure justice. While the legal system often reflects societal values, it primarily seeks to govern interactions among individuals and groups. The function of law is primarily external, as it governs actions rather than internal motivations. An ethical obligation, in other words, might be reflected in legal rules, but not all wrong actions are illegal by definition. New legislation does not always deal with ethical issues and will not always follow moral standards, since public order and regulation of behavior outweigh normative ethics.\n ... \nSome speech most Americans regard as \u201cwrong\u201d are, nonetheless, protected by the U.S. Constitution. The government is expected to allow this speech as part of the free exchange of ideas that allows for differences, even when the majority finds the speech reprehensible and wrong. Aristotle\u2019s advocacy for moderation \u2013 \u201cAnyone can become angry\u2026 but to be angry with the right person, to the right degree, at the right time, for the right purpose, and in the right way\u201d \u2013 suggests that ethical speech involves responsible expression, even in contexts where law may permit harmful language. Aristotle would say the solution to speech lacking integrity isn\u2019t more regulations but creating a conversation focused on ethics and principles, helping people see the difference between right and wrong. The difference between ethics and the law is not a problem of just one country; it is part of any political system. It is essential for every law student to understand the intricate relationship between law and ethics and understand the difference between legal and ethical behavior.",

Not only is this theoretically possible, but scientists are actively developing two-way communication with other animals. If we do gain this ability, it would have profound implications for animal rights , conservation and our understanding of animal sentience. Interspecies Communication Before AI\nOne definition of the word \u201ccommunication \u201d is \u201ca process by which information is exchanged between individuals through a common system of symbols, signs, or behavior.\u201d By this definition, humans have communicated with dogs for thousands of years to domesticate them.\n ... \nChatGPT finds patterns in text to generate answers, your photo app uses patterns in pixels to identify what\u2019s in the photo, and voice-to-text applications find patterns in audio signals to turn spoken sound into written language. It\u2019s easier to find useful patterns if you have a lot of data to learn from . Easy access to massive amounts of data on the Internet is part of the reason why artificial intelligence has gotten so much better in recent years. Researchers are also figuring out how to write better software that can find more complex, useful patterns in the data that we have. With rapidly improving algorithms and an abundance of data, we seem to have reached a tipping point in the last few years where powerful new AI tools have become possible, taking the world by storm with their surprising usefulness. It turns out these same approaches can be applied to animal communication, too. The Rise of AI in Animal Communication Research\nAnimals, including human animals, make noises and body expressions that are all just different types of data \u2014 audio data, visual data and even pheromone data . Machine learning algorithms can take that data and use it to detect patterns. With the help of animal welfare scientists, AI can help us figure out that one noise is the sound of a happy animal, while a different noise is the sound of an animal in distress .",

We can thank conventional animal communication research for the discoveries that [honey bees\u2019 dance performances convey information about the location of food sources](https://www.degruyterbrill.com/document/doi/10.4159/harvard.9780674418776/html?lang=en) , and that [Bengalese finches use grammar](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.2869) \u2014 a learned ability. But artificial intelligence (AI) is shaking up the field of animal communication. The key breakthrough came in 2017, when [researchers developed machine learning models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.11041) capable of translating human languages where no words were already known. The models were trained to turn the languages into shapes, placing words that frequently appeared together at nearby geometric points. Astonishingly, when the language-shape of an unknown language was overlaid with the language-shape of a known language, they lined up. Any word in the unknown language could then be translated by locating its corresponding point in the known language\u2019s shape.\n ... \nIt\u2019s for this reason that she\u2019s calling for ethical guidelines dictating that \u201cAI should not be implemented to benefit activities or industries that systemically overlook animals\u2019 interests in avoiding suffering and continuing to live.\u201d Veuthey, too, would like to see regulatory frameworks and legal measures developed to \u201cprevent misuse and ensure accountability in the application of AI for interspecies communication.\u201d\n\nInitiatives like the [More Than Human Life Project](https://mothrights.org/) are already developing [guidelines](https://www.openglobalrights.org/listening-to-the-more-than-human-world-legal-and-ethical-principles-for-nonhuman-animal-communication-technologies/) for the ethical use of \u201cnonhuman animal communication technologies\u201d \u2014 though it\u2019s uncertain whether such guidelines would eventually become law. ### **Could interspecies communication help wild animals? **\n\nFortunately, there are also hopeful possibilities for how interspecies communication could positively impact wild animal welfare. Aza Raskin, cofounder of the [Earth Species Project](https://www.earthspecies.org/) \u2014 the organization at the forefront of efforts to decode animal communication \u2014 [has argued](https://www.kuow.org/stories/digital-dr-dolittle-decoding-animal-conversation-1) that the ability to understand animal signals might trigger a seismic shift in human-nonhuman relations.",

        "description": "\nScenario planning is a process [pioneered\n by the U.S. military](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR2173z1.html) , which today runs exercises looking up to 20 years out to guide\n R&D efforts. ## Why Is Scenario Planning Important? Scenario planning can provide a competitive advantage by enabling leaders to react quickly\n and decisively \u2014 because a situation has been thought through and actions documented,\n no one has to scramble when in the midst of a crisis. Scenario planning also gives executives and boards of directors a framework to make\n nonemergency decisions more effectively by providing insight into plans, budgets and\n forecasts and painting a clearer picture of key [drivers for\n business growth](/portal/resource/articles/financial-management/the-key-drivers-and-challenges-to-international-growth-a-finance-teams-perspective.shtml) and the potential impact of future events. ### Scenario Planning Advantages and Disadvantages\n\nA comprehensive scenario planning exercise takes time, effort and money. Should you commit? ### _Advantages:_\n\n* Scenario planning will help executives understand the effects of various plausible\n   events. * Finance, operations and other teams can prepare initial responses. * There's an element of knowledge management; by having key\n   personnel take part, the company captures their insights and recommendations. * If these stakeholders are unavailable during an actual extreme event, the company has\n   documentation to fall back on.\n ... \n* \n  ### Normative scenarios\n  \n  \n  \n  These describe a preferred or achievable end state. These scenarios are less\n   objective planning and more geared toward statements of goals. These goals are not\n   necessarily about an organizational vision, but more about how the company would\n   like to operate in the future. Normative scenarios are often combined with other\n   types of scenario planning as they provide a summation of changes and a targeted\n   list of activities. * \n  ### Strategic management scenarios\n  \n  \n  \n  Essentially stories that say little about the company or industry, but more about\n   the environment in which products and services are consumed. These are often the\n   most challenging scenarios for company leaders to put together because they require\n   a broad industry, economic and world view. On the plus side, they give planners\n   freedom to brainstorm decisions and a broad storytelling mandate. In some cases,\n   companies bring in analysts or [even so-called futurists (opens in new tab)](https://www.technologyreview.com/2016/12/28/243894/how-to-think-like-a-futurist/) . ## How to Use Scenario Planning\n\nTypically, macroeconomic expectations are used in conjunction with scenario planning to help\n the CFO frame near-term expectations for the company and to level-set expectations in\n departments. The fundamentals of scenario planning are the same, even if the particulars across industries\n and within businesses vary.",

Unlike traditional planning, strategic foresight does not assume stability. It considers disruptions, new trends, and technological advancements that could reshape industries. By applying foresight systematically, organizations gain insight into potential risks and opportunities before they emerge. ### How strategic foresight differs from traditional forecasting\n\nTraditional forecasting relies on past data to predict what is likely to happen. It assumes that historical patterns will continue, making it useful for short-term planning. However, this approach often fails when dealing with high uncertainty or unprecedented shifts in the world. Strategic foresight, on the other hand, embraces uncertainty. It explores multiple trend developments, allowing organizations to assess the importance of each trend relative to their strategies continuously.\n ... \nThis minimizes uncertainty and reduces the risk of being caught off guard by transformational shifts in their industry. ### Scenario planning: How do key drivers of change influence future-ready business strategies\n\nScenario planning is a traditional tool in strategic foresight that prepares for multiple possible future developments. Instead of relying on a single forecast, organizations create different plausible scenarios based on key drivers of change. These scenarios consider how factors like new technologies, geopolitical events, or climate policies might develop. For each factor, different projections are created. The likelihood of co-occurrence of these projections is calculated and leads to different consistent scenarios. In explorative scenario planning, organizations then develop response actions for each scenario, ensuring that they can adapt quickly when changes occur. It is yet worth noting that scenario analysis has lost relevance over the years due to a lack of direct impact on problem-solving, creation effort, and the rise of AI foresight tools. ### Business opportunity development: From trends to fields of action\n\nTo make foresight effective, all the collected foresight intelligence needs to result in a clear presentation of [potential opportunities](/environmental-scanning) to increase market share, and profitability, or create new profit for the leadership team.",

Scenario planning is a method of forecasting and [analysis](/blog/what-is-financial-planning-analysis-fpa-software) that takes a variety of assumptions to drive different outcomes in the future. This planning method can be traced back to the days of the Cold War when analysts used existing information to predict how nuclear war could play out to manage uncertainties better. Though nuclear war could be considered an extreme scenario, a global pandemic has done just that, reminding finance and business leaders of the importance of planning for the unknown.

It involves examining multiple potential futures and creating and comparing scenarios considering business revenue over time.\n ... \n## **Types of scenario planning**\n\nFP&A professionals use multiple types of strategy planning to analyze and prepare for a wide range of potential future scenarios. Let's examine four common types of scenario planning, each designed for a specific purpose and providing essential tools for informed decision-making in a rapidly changing environment. ### Quantitative scenarios\n\nThese scenarios are based on financial models, presenting both the best and worst possible outcomes. They allow for quick adjustments by changing key variables and are commonly used for annual business forecasts. Quantitative scenarios help businesses put a value on possible risks so they can plan financially for any unforeseen events. ### Operational scenarios\n\nOperational scenarios are what-if situations that organizations use to prepare for events or crises that may affect their current operations. Basically, these scenarios focus on an event's immediate impact. They help organizations explore short-term [operational plans](/blog/operational-planning-vs-strategic-planning) and strategic implications and responses to specific situations. ### Normative scenarios\n\nNormative scenarios describe a preferred or achievable end state, emphasizing goals and how the company envisions operating in the future. In addition to outlining future organizational performance, normative scenarios enable organizations to develop roadmaps to achieving their goals.",

        "description": "\n[Explore scenario planning with SAP](//www.sap.com/products/financial-management/financial-planning-analysis-fpa.html)\n\n## Scenario planning meaning and definition\n\nScenario planning looks at different future scenarios and considers varied combinations of assumptions and events. These scenarios are not predictions or forecasts but alternative views of how the future could unfold. By analyzing these scenarios, organizations can anticipate potential challenges and opportunities, helping them to react effectively as events unfold. Developed initially for military strategies and later embraced by the corporate world, scenario planning is beneficial in uncertain, complex, or rapidly changing environments. It allows organizations to test strategies against possible future states, understand the impacts of recent decisions, and increase their preparedness for unexpected events. Essentially, scenario planning shifts the focus from trying to predict the future to understanding the dynamics that will shape it. ## Why is scenario planning important? In an ever-evolving global landscape, uncertainties abound. Whether they be geopolitical changes, market fluctuations, or technological advancements, these uncertainties can significantly impact an organization\u2019s future. Scenario planning is essential as it helps organizations to navigate these uncertainties by envisaging various outcomes and preparing strategies accordingly.\n ... \n* \n  **Agent-based modeling:** This technique is used for simulating interactions of autonomous agents (e.g., consumers, companies) to assess their effects on the system as a whole. ##### Data visualization\n\nData visualization tools are crucial for effectively communicating the outcomes of scenario analysis. These tools help in creating graphs, charts, and other visual aids to represent data in an easily digestible form. By visually representing the data, organizations can better understand the trends and patterns that emerge from the scenario analysis. Combining scenario building, simulation models, and data visualization tools in scenario planning can provide organizations with a more comprehensive, informed, and visual representation of potential future states. This, in turn, supports more robust [strategic planning](//www.sap.com/products/financial-management/what-is-financial-planning-and-analysis-fpa.html) and decision-making processes. * * *\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe rapidly changing business environment and the unpredictability of markets make it more important than ever for organizations to be prepared for various eventualities. Scenario planning stands as a critical strategic tool that enables businesses to navigate the murky waters of uncertainty by envisaging multiple future states. Scenario planning holds the power to transform organizations by instilling a culture of strategic thinking and adaptability.",

Collaborators may come from one or more institutions. NEH encourages partnerships with researchers in the natural and social sciences, but projects must focus on humanistic content and employ humanistic methods. International collaboration is welcome, but scholars at U.S. institutions must contribute significantly to the project. Proposed projects must aim to result in tangible and sustainable outcomes, such as a co-authored or multi-authored book; a themed issue of a peer-reviewed journal; a series of peer-reviewed articles; a born-digital publication; or an open-access website or other digital resource. All project outcomes must incorporate collaboration and interpretation to address significant humanities research questions. The program includes four project categories: Planning International Collaboration, Convening, Manuscript Preparation, and Scholarly Digital Projects. The categories support different project types or stages and have different performance periods and award ceilings.",

In the UN system, it\u2019s a principle of governance that holds governments, institutions, and people accountable to human rights laws. Whenever there\u2019s a violation of human rights, the abuser must be held accountable according to international human rights standards. [Rule of law is an essential](https://coursera.pxf.io/citizenship-rule-of-law) ethic because it turns universal rights from an idea into reality. It\u2019s the primary enforcement mechanism. Equality, fairness, participation, and transparency are all important in the law-making process and enforcement of the law. The rule of law is necessary for international peace, security, economic development, and social progress. Without laws, there\u2019s no check on human rights abuses or a framework to ensure rights like education, healthcare, etc are provided to everyone.

        "title": "Law vs. Ethics: The Debate Over What's Legal and What's Right",
        "description": "Last updated: Dec 23, 2024\nBecause law is created and enforced by recognized authorities, it holds the power to compel individuals and organizations to conform to specific rules. In legal terms, laws are valid regardless of ethics, including individual beliefs or moral perspectives. Ethics stem from cultural norms and/or religious beliefs. Ethics does not depend on formal institutions for validation \u2013 ethics are based on individual and collective moral judgments and are not enforced by the political power of the government that compels obedience. Aristotle highlighted this distinction, noting that ethics is a \u201creasoned choice\u201d rather than a mandated obligation. When Aristotle defined the purpose of law, he emphasized its role in regulating behavior and maintaining public order. Aristotle referred to the Politeia (political community) and how law serves a practical, utilitarian function in governance. Aristotle also explained there is room in the legal system to ensure justice. While the legal system often reflects societal values, it primarily seeks to govern interactions among individuals and groups. The function of law is primarily external, as it governs actions rather than internal motivations. An ethical obligation, in other words, might be reflected in legal rules, but not all wrong actions are illegal by definition. New legislation does not always deal with ethical issues and will not always follow moral standards, since public order and regulation of behavior outweigh normative ethics.\n ... \nSome speech most Americans regard as \u201cwrong\u201d are, nonetheless, protected by the U.S. Constitution. The government is expected to allow this speech as part of the free exchange of ideas that allows for differences, even when the majority finds the speech reprehensible and wrong. Aristotle\u2019s advocacy for moderation \u2013 \u201cAnyone can become angry\u2026 but to be angry with the right person, to the right degree, at the right time, for the right purpose, and in the right way\u201d \u2013 suggests that ethical speech involves responsible expression, even in contexts where law may permit harmful language. Aristotle would say the solution to speech lacking integrity isn\u2019t more regulations but creating a conversation focused on ethics and principles, helping people see the difference between right and wrong. The difference between ethics and the law is not a problem of just one country; it is part of any political system. It is essential for every law student to understand the intricate relationship between law and ethics and understand the difference between legal and ethical behavior.",

Or a member of the public complaining that staff (or a council/board member, or the chief executive) was rude to them, did not respond to them, or otherwise treated them in a way that the person thought was inappropriate. ## Law vs. Ethics\n\nThese questions often have two components: 1) What is the legal authority for \u201cthat\u201d and 2) \u201cshould\u201d the person/agency/body do \u201cthat.\u201d Retired MRSC Legal Consultant Jim Doherty once wrote on this topic, noting:\n\n> Actions are \u201clegal\u201d if they do not violate the laws or codes of the local government, state, or federal government. Actions are \u2018ethical\u2019 or \u2018moral\u2019 (I will treat the words as synonymous in this article) if they meet an individual\u2019s personal code of conduct, which may be based on a particular social, religious, or other group norms. \u201cLegal\u201d is easy; \u201cEthics\u201d is not.\n ... \nThe agency will also have to remember that its officials and employees do not lose their First Amendment rights merely because they now work for a government agency. MRSC has written extensively about this issue as well (see [Adverse Employment Action for Employee Social Media Use: Balancing First Amendment Rights and Governmental Efficiency](https://mrsc.org/stay-informed/mrsc-insight/march-2022/adverse-employment-action-for-employee-social-medi) , [Political Speech and Lobbying by Local Government Employees: What are the Rules of Engagement? ](https://mrsc.org/stay-informed/mrsc-insight/april-2017/political-speech-and-lobbying-by-local-government) )\n\nWe\u2019ve also covered how members of the public have First Amendment rights when addressing their elected officials or interacting with staff (see [When First Amendment Rights and Public Meetings Clash](https://mrsc.org/stay-informed/mrsc-insight/july-2020/when-1st-amendment-rights-public-meetings-clash) , [Rights and Limits on Filming in Public Facilities](https://mrsc.org/stay-informed/mrsc-insight/april-2023/rights-and-limits-on-filming-in-public-facilities) ). ### So, do you have an answer for us or not? Not. All these options lead right back to the problem of what are \u201cprinciples of right behavior\u201d and what are the bases for those principles?

Not only is this theoretically possible, but scientists are actively developing two-way communication with other animals. If we do gain this ability, it would have profound implications for animal rights , conservation and our understanding of animal sentience. Interspecies Communication Before AI\nOne definition of the word \u201ccommunication \u201d is \u201ca process by which information is exchanged between individuals through a common system of symbols, signs, or behavior.\u201d By this definition, humans have communicated with dogs for thousands of years to domesticate them.\n ... \nChatGPT finds patterns in text to generate answers, your photo app uses patterns in pixels to identify what\u2019s in the photo, and voice-to-text applications find patterns in audio signals to turn spoken sound into written language. It\u2019s easier to find useful patterns if you have a lot of data to learn from . Easy access to massive amounts of data on the Internet is part of the reason why artificial intelligence has gotten so much better in recent years. Researchers are also figuring out how to write better software that can find more complex, useful patterns in the data that we have. With rapidly improving algorithms and an abundance of data, we seem to have reached a tipping point in the last few years where powerful new AI tools have become possible, taking the world by storm with their surprising usefulness. It turns out these same approaches can be applied to animal communication, too. The Rise of AI in Animal Communication Research\nAnimals, including human animals, make noises and body expressions that are all just different types of data \u2014 audio data, visual data and even pheromone data . Machine learning algorithms can take that data and use it to detect patterns. With the help of animal welfare scientists, AI can help us figure out that one noise is the sound of a happy animal, while a different noise is the sound of an animal in distress .",

Although state-of-the-art deep learning models have demonstrated remarkable accuracy in classifying various forms of animal data, their adoption in animal behavior studies remains limited. This survey article endeavors to comprehensively explore deep learning architectures and strategies applied to the identification of animal behavior, spanning auditory, visual, and audiovisual methodologies. The survey categorizes techniques into pose estimation-based and non-pose estimation-based methods, analyzing their applications, effectiveness, and limitations. Furthermore, the manuscript scrutinizes extant animal behavior datasets, offering a detailed examination of the principal challenges confronting this research domain. The article culminates in a comprehensive discussion of key research directions within deep learning that hold potential for advancing the field of animal behavior studies. * Previous article in issue\n* Next article in issue\n\n## Keywords\n\nAnimal behavior\n\nDeep learning\n\nPose estimation\n\nObject detection\n\nBio-acoustics\n\nMachine learning\n\nRecommended articles\n\n## Data availability\n\nNo data was used for the research described in the article. ## Cited by (0)\n\n\u00a9 2025 The Author(s).\nPublished by Elsevier Ltd.\n\n## Recommended articles\n\nNo articles found.

Beyond detecting the presence of wildlife, bioacoustic signals can reveal their behavior. However, behavioral bioacoustic information is underused because identifying the function and context of animals\u2019 sounds remains challenging. A growing acoustic toolbox is allowing researchers to begin decoding bioacoustic signals by linking individual and population-level sensing. Yet, studies integrating acoustic tools for behavioral insight across levels of biological organization remain scarce. We aim to catalyze the emerging field of behavioral bioacoustics by synthesizing recent successes and rising analytical, logistical, and ethical challenges. Because behavior typically represents animals\u2019 first response to environmental change, we posit that behavioral bioacoustics will provide theoretical and applied insights into animals\u2019 adaptations to global change. * Previous article in issue\n    * Next article in issue\n\nKeywords\nbioacoustics\nbehavioral ecology\nglobal change\nbiologging\npassive acoustic monitoring\nRecommended articles\nCited by (0)\n\u00a9 2024 The Author(s).

The processes involved in how and why animals communicate have long held veritable fascination for scientists. A branch of science concerned with the production of sound and its effects on living organisms is bioacoustics. The main purpose of the present study is to raise and discuss some issues related to the relationship between animals, their sounds and ecology, including presentation of methods of analysis of sound recordings.\nA better understanding of the relationship between the studied animals will allow for development of a better framework for future research, as well as a better grasp of interactions between different organisms, including humans. The paper discusses the significance of acoustic research in animal ecology and its possible applications in the future. The author also summarizes previous research in the field of sound communication of various animal species. The paper proves that vocalizations of every acoustically communicating animal are threatened by climate change. For marine animals, the source of changes in vocalization abilities is ocean acidification and increased ambient noise, which can affect communication and foraging behavior. For terrestrial animals, changes in precipitation and temperature may result in modifications of the sounds emitted, as well as certain modifications to the auditory system. Together with changes in species distribution due to environmental parameters, cumulatively these factors can cause changes in the entire landscape of acoustics ecosystems. Thanks to acoustic biomonitoring, we can understand how the sounds of entire habitats and acoustic ecosystems will change in response to the changing climate and how it will affect bioacoustics on a global scale.",

        "description": "\nScenario planning is a process [pioneered\n by the U.S. military](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR2173z1.html) , which today runs exercises looking up to 20 years out to guide\n R&D efforts. ## Why Is Scenario Planning Important? Scenario planning can provide a competitive advantage by enabling leaders to react quickly\n and decisively \u2014 because a situation has been thought through and actions documented,\n no one has to scramble when in the midst of a crisis. Scenario planning also gives executives and boards of directors a framework to make\n nonemergency decisions more effectively by providing insight into plans, budgets and\n forecasts and painting a clearer picture of key [drivers for\n business growth](/portal/resource/articles/financial-management/the-key-drivers-and-challenges-to-international-growth-a-finance-teams-perspective.shtml) and the potential impact of future events. ### Scenario Planning Advantages and Disadvantages\n\nA comprehensive scenario planning exercise takes time, effort and money. Should you commit? ### _Advantages:_\n\n* Scenario planning will help executives understand the effects of various plausible\n   events. * Finance, operations and other teams can prepare initial responses. * There's an element of knowledge management; by having key\n   personnel take part, the company captures their insights and recommendations. * If these stakeholders are unavailable during an actual extreme event, the company has\n   documentation to fall back on.\n ... \n* \n  ### Normative scenarios\n  \n  \n  \n  These describe a preferred or achievable end state. These scenarios are less\n   objective planning and more geared toward statements of goals. These goals are not\n   necessarily about an organizational vision, but more about how the company would\n   like to operate in the future. Normative scenarios are often combined with other\n   types of scenario planning as they provide a summation of changes and a targeted\n   list of activities. * \n  ### Strategic management scenarios\n  \n  \n  \n  Essentially stories that say little about the company or industry, but more about\n   the environment in which products and services are consumed. These are often the\n   most challenging scenarios for company leaders to put together because they require\n   a broad industry, economic and world view. On the plus side, they give planners\n   freedom to brainstorm decisions and a broad storytelling mandate. In some cases,\n   companies bring in analysts or [even so-called futurists (opens in new tab)](https://www.technologyreview.com/2016/12/28/243894/how-to-think-like-a-futurist/) . ## How to Use Scenario Planning\n\nTypically, macroeconomic expectations are used in conjunction with scenario planning to help\n the CFO frame near-term expectations for the company and to level-set expectations in\n departments. The fundamentals of scenario planning are the same, even if the particulars across industries\n and within businesses vary.",

Unlike traditional planning, strategic foresight does not assume stability. It considers disruptions, new trends, and technological advancements that could reshape industries. By applying foresight systematically, organizations gain insight into potential risks and opportunities before they emerge. ### How strategic foresight differs from traditional forecasting\n\nTraditional forecasting relies on past data to predict what is likely to happen. It assumes that historical patterns will continue, making it useful for short-term planning. However, this approach often fails when dealing with high uncertainty or unprecedented shifts in the world. Strategic foresight, on the other hand, embraces uncertainty. It explores multiple trend developments, allowing organizations to assess the importance of each trend relative to their strategies continuously.\n ... \nThis minimizes uncertainty and reduces the risk of being caught off guard by transformational shifts in their industry. ### Scenario planning: How do key drivers of change influence future-ready business strategies\n\nScenario planning is a traditional tool in strategic foresight that prepares for multiple possible future developments. Instead of relying on a single forecast, organizations create different plausible scenarios based on key drivers of change. These scenarios consider how factors like new technologies, geopolitical events, or climate policies might develop. For each factor, different projections are created. The likelihood of co-occurrence of these projections is calculated and leads to different consistent scenarios. In explorative scenario planning, organizations then develop response actions for each scenario, ensuring that they can adapt quickly when changes occur. It is yet worth noting that scenario analysis has lost relevance over the years due to a lack of direct impact on problem-solving, creation effort, and the rise of AI foresight tools. ### Business opportunity development: From trends to fields of action\n\nTo make foresight effective, all the collected foresight intelligence needs to result in a clear presentation of [potential opportunities](/environmental-scanning) to increase market share, and profitability, or create new profit for the leadership team.",

It involves examining multiple potential futures and creating and comparing scenarios considering business revenue over time.\n ... \n## **Types of scenario planning**\n\nFP&A professionals use multiple types of strategy planning to analyze and prepare for a wide range of potential future scenarios. Let's examine four common types of scenario planning, each designed for a specific purpose and providing essential tools for informed decision-making in a rapidly changing environment. ### Quantitative scenarios\n\nThese scenarios are based on financial models, presenting both the best and worst possible outcomes. They allow for quick adjustments by changing key variables and are commonly used for annual business forecasts. Quantitative scenarios help businesses put a value on possible risks so they can plan financially for any unforeseen events. ### Operational scenarios\n\nOperational scenarios are what-if situations that organizations use to prepare for events or crises that may affect their current operations. Basically, these scenarios focus on an event's immediate impact. They help organizations explore short-term [operational plans](/blog/operational-planning-vs-strategic-planning) and strategic implications and responses to specific situations. ### Normative scenarios\n\nNormative scenarios describe a preferred or achievable end state, emphasizing goals and how the company envisions operating in the future. In addition to outlining future organizational performance, normative scenarios enable organizations to develop roadmaps to achieving their goals.",

Strategic planning tools empower businesses to stay on top of these trends and make a lasting impact in their industries. Build your strategy for the future by evaluating these trends. 1.\nResilience Planning\nThe last few years have come with extreme ups and downs. Economy shifts and market changes have significantly impacted new and established companies. Neglecting the importance of confronting unforeseen circumstances is one of the most\u00a0 common strategic planning failures . Businesses can gain confidence moving forward with resilience planning. Resilience planning involves creating initiatives to expand business continuity during uncertain times. It\u00a0 comes with many advantages , such as fostering a more collaborative environment and enhancing visibility. The key to maintaining a resilient organization is developing unique approaches that enable flexibility and responsiveness. In any fast-changing environment, there\u2019s always a need to consider \u201cwhat if\u201d scenarios. During unpredictable changes or volatile market fluctuations, your strategy and execution should be able to assess, adapt and realign your resources as needed. Implementing new tools for strategic planning can enhance your approach\u2019s overall effectiveness. Your future strategy should include tools to prevent or minimize the effects of cyberattacks, global pandemics, war, economic downturns, environmental events and the disruptions of a new competitor. 2. Collaboration\nStrategic planning means little if your departments and teams operate separately. Cross-functional teams are essential for bringing your organization together and driving progress.",

        "description": "\n[Explore scenario planning with SAP](//www.sap.com/products/financial-management/financial-planning-analysis-fpa.html)\n\n## Scenario planning meaning and definition\n\nScenario planning looks at different future scenarios and considers varied combinations of assumptions and events. These scenarios are not predictions or forecasts but alternative views of how the future could unfold. By analyzing these scenarios, organizations can anticipate potential challenges and opportunities, helping them to react effectively as events unfold. Developed initially for military strategies and later embraced by the corporate world, scenario planning is beneficial in uncertain, complex, or rapidly changing environments. It allows organizations to test strategies against possible future states, understand the impacts of recent decisions, and increase their preparedness for unexpected events. Essentially, scenario planning shifts the focus from trying to predict the future to understanding the dynamics that will shape it. ## Why is scenario planning important? In an ever-evolving global landscape, uncertainties abound. Whether they be geopolitical changes, market fluctuations, or technological advancements, these uncertainties can significantly impact an organization\u2019s future. Scenario planning is essential as it helps organizations to navigate these uncertainties by envisaging various outcomes and preparing strategies accordingly.\n ... \n* \n  **Agent-based modeling:** This technique is used for simulating interactions of autonomous agents (e.g., consumers, companies) to assess their effects on the system as a whole. ##### Data visualization\n\nData visualization tools are crucial for effectively communicating the outcomes of scenario analysis. These tools help in creating graphs, charts, and other visual aids to represent data in an easily digestible form. By visually representing the data, organizations can better understand the trends and patterns that emerge from the scenario analysis. Combining scenario building, simulation models, and data visualization tools in scenario planning can provide organizations with a more comprehensive, informed, and visual representation of potential future states. This, in turn, supports more robust [strategic planning](//www.sap.com/products/financial-management/what-is-financial-planning-and-analysis-fpa.html) and decision-making processes. * * *\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe rapidly changing business environment and the unpredictability of markets make it more important than ever for organizations to be prepared for various eventualities. Scenario planning stands as a critical strategic tool that enables businesses to navigate the murky waters of uncertainty by envisaging multiple future states. Scenario planning holds the power to transform organizations by instilling a culture of strategic thinking and adaptability.",

        "title": "10 Sensor Technologies Making Waves in 2025",
        "description": "Last updated: Nov 18, 2024\nAs an electronic engineer or designer, you're standing at the forefront of a sensor revolution that promises to unleash the next generation of electronic innovation. We're living in a world where cars can see better than humans, your watch knows you're getting sick before you do, and factories can predict and prevent breakdowns before they happen. From [autonomous vehicles](https://octopart.com/pulse/p/8-component-trends-driving-innovation-automotive-industry) to personalized healthcare, sensors are powering innovation across sectors. Staying ahead of the curve in sensor technology is essential for those looking to succeed in our rapidly changing industry. With that in mind, let's take a look at ten types of sensors that will be making waves in 2025:\n\nRemember when cameras just took pictures? Those days are long gone. [AI-enhanced imaging sensors](https://octopart.com/pulse/p/ai-enhanced-imaging-sensors) are like giving eyes to machines \u2013 eyes that never blink, never get tired and can see things humans can't. These sensors combine high-resolution imaging with on-chip AI processing to enable capabilities like real-time object recognition and facial analysis. Someday soon they might even be able to detect emotion. AI-enhanced imaging sensors are being used in a range of applications, from autonomous vehicles that can navigate complex urban environments to security systems that can detect potential threats as they arise.\n ... \nDesigned to mimic the structure and function of biological neural networks, these sensors process information in ways that are eerily similar to the human brain. The result? Sensors that can learn, adapt, and make decisions on the fly. Neuromorphic sensors are expected to play an increasingly important role in advanced AI systems, potentially enabling more efficient and intelligent data processing at the edge. While not strictly a sensor, BrainChip's [Akida neural network processor chip](https://brainchip.com/akida-neural-processor-soc/) can be integrated with various sensors to enable neuromorphic processing of sensor data. Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) sensors have been around for a while, but they're about to get a serious upgrade. In 2025, we expect to see MEMS sensors that are smaller, more precise, and capable of measuring a wider range of physical phenomena. These tiny titans will enable next-gen IoT devices, from ultra-sensitive accelerometers that can detect the slightest movements to miniature spectrometers that can analyze chemical compositions. [Bosch's Sensortec BMI270](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/products/motion-sensors/imus/bmi270/) high-performance IMU, for example, combines a MEMS accelerometer and a MEMS gyroscope in one tiny package, making it ideal for wearables and IoT devices. Graphene sometimes called the wonder material of the 21st century, is set to make a big splash in the world of sensors.",

        "description": "\nScenario planning is a process [pioneered\n by the U.S. military](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR2173z1.html) , which today runs exercises looking up to 20 years out to guide\n R&D efforts. ## Why Is Scenario Planning Important? Scenario planning can provide a competitive advantage by enabling leaders to react quickly\n and decisively \u2014 because a situation has been thought through and actions documented,\n no one has to scramble when in the midst of a crisis. Scenario planning also gives executives and boards of directors a framework to make\n nonemergency decisions more effectively by providing insight into plans, budgets and\n forecasts and painting a clearer picture of key [drivers for\n business growth](/portal/resource/articles/financial-management/the-key-drivers-and-challenges-to-international-growth-a-finance-teams-perspective.shtml) and the potential impact of future events. ### Scenario Planning Advantages and Disadvantages\n\nA comprehensive scenario planning exercise takes time, effort and money. Should you commit? ### _Advantages:_\n\n* Scenario planning will help executives understand the effects of various plausible\n   events. * Finance, operations and other teams can prepare initial responses. * There's an element of knowledge management; by having key\n   personnel take part, the company captures their insights and recommendations. * If these stakeholders are unavailable during an actual extreme event, the company has\n   documentation to fall back on.\n ... \n* \n  ### Normative scenarios\n  \n  \n  \n  These describe a preferred or achievable end state. These scenarios are less\n   objective planning and more geared toward statements of goals. These goals are not\n   necessarily about an organizational vision, but more about how the company would\n   like to operate in the future. Normative scenarios are often combined with other\n   types of scenario planning as they provide a summation of changes and a targeted\n   list of activities. * \n  ### Strategic management scenarios\n  \n  \n  \n  Essentially stories that say little about the company or industry, but more about\n   the environment in which products and services are consumed. These are often the\n   most challenging scenarios for company leaders to put together because they require\n   a broad industry, economic and world view. On the plus side, they give planners\n   freedom to brainstorm decisions and a broad storytelling mandate. In some cases,\n   companies bring in analysts or [even so-called futurists (opens in new tab)](https://www.technologyreview.com/2016/12/28/243894/how-to-think-like-a-futurist/) . ## How to Use Scenario Planning\n\nTypically, macroeconomic expectations are used in conjunction with scenario planning to help\n the CFO frame near-term expectations for the company and to level-set expectations in\n departments. The fundamentals of scenario planning are the same, even if the particulars across industries\n and within businesses vary.",

        "description": "Last updated: Jul 25, 2025\nA successful strategic foresight process typically includes environmental scanning, trend and technology analysis, scenario development, implications mapping, and integration into strategy and innovation planning. ### What are some common strategic foresight methods? Popular foresight methods include scenario planning, Delphi studies, horizon scanning, trend radars, backcasting, and cross-impact analysis. These techniques help teams explore plausible futures and shape proactive strategies. ### What software tools support strategic foresight? Strategic foresight software helps teams identify trends, build scenarios, visualize future landscapes, and align foresight insights with innovation strategy. Platforms like [ITONICS Foresight](/foresight) provide integrated tools for environmental scanning, trend radars, weak signal detection, and collaborative planning. ## The importance of strategic foresight\n\nIn an unpredictable world, organizations must go beyond short-term planning to remain competitive. Strategic foresight helps organizations anticipate probable futures, [identify new trends](/industry-insights) , and prepare for multiple possibilities. It is a proactive, systematic approach that enables firms to shape desired futures rather than simply reacting to change. [!\n ... \nThis minimizes uncertainty and reduces the risk of being caught off guard by transformational shifts in their industry. ### Scenario planning: How do key drivers of change influence future-ready business strategies\n\nScenario planning is a traditional tool in strategic foresight that prepares for multiple possible future developments. Instead of relying on a single forecast, organizations create different plausible scenarios based on key drivers of change. These scenarios consider how factors like new technologies, geopolitical events, or climate policies might develop. For each factor, different projections are created. The likelihood of co-occurrence of these projections is calculated and leads to different consistent scenarios. In explorative scenario planning, organizations then develop response actions for each scenario, ensuring that they can adapt quickly when changes occur. It is yet worth noting that scenario analysis has lost relevance over the years due to a lack of direct impact on problem-solving, creation effort, and the rise of AI foresight tools. ### Business opportunity development: From trends to fields of action\n\nTo make foresight effective, all the collected foresight intelligence needs to result in a clear presentation of [potential opportunities](/environmental-scanning) to increase market share, and profitability, or create new profit for the leadership team.",

These norms often dictate what is acceptable behavior in society. For instance, a majority of societies are determined by cultural norms on gender roles. Men and women are assigned specific roles differently, leading to gender inequality. These cultural traditions make issues of such women's rights and equal opportunities difficult to deal with. At times, cultural differences themselves fuel social issues. Clashes between different cultural beliefs in multicultural societies may lead to discrimination or prejudice. Such a division, if not controlled properly, could increase the tension between communities. The lack of understanding various cultures is one major factor behind this problem.",

        "description": "Last updated: May 31, 2025\nScientists have conducted [playback experiments](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4528452/) to test how animals respond to various sonic cues, and even [deliberately made themselves the subjects of animals\u2019 communications](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10071-008-0203-y) . We can thank conventional animal communication research for the discoveries that [honey bees\u2019 dance performances convey information about the location of food sources](https://www.degruyterbrill.com/document/doi/10.4159/harvard.9780674418776/html?lang=en) , and that [Bengalese finches use grammar](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.2869) \u2014 a learned ability. But artificial intelligence (AI) is shaking up the field of animal communication. The key breakthrough came in 2017, when [researchers developed machine learning models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.11041) capable of translating human languages where no words were already known. The models were trained to turn the languages into shapes, placing words that frequently appeared together at nearby geometric points. Astonishingly, when the language-shape of an unknown language was overlaid with the language-shape of a known language, they lined up. Any word in the unknown language could then be translated by locating its corresponding point in the known language\u2019s shape.\n ... \nIt\u2019s for this reason that she\u2019s calling for ethical guidelines dictating that \u201cAI should not be implemented to benefit activities or industries that systemically overlook animals\u2019 interests in avoiding suffering and continuing to live.\u201d Veuthey, too, would like to see regulatory frameworks and legal measures developed to \u201cprevent misuse and ensure accountability in the application of AI for interspecies communication.\u201d\n\nInitiatives like the [More Than Human Life Project](https://mothrights.org/) are already developing [guidelines](https://www.openglobalrights.org/listening-to-the-more-than-human-world-legal-and-ethical-principles-for-nonhuman-animal-communication-technologies/) for the ethical use of \u201cnonhuman animal communication technologies\u201d \u2014 though it\u2019s uncertain whether such guidelines would eventually become law. ### **Could interspecies communication help wild animals? **\n\nFortunately, there are also hopeful possibilities for how interspecies communication could positively impact wild animal welfare. Aza Raskin, cofounder of the [Earth Species Project](https://www.earthspecies.org/) \u2014 the organization at the forefront of efforts to decode animal communication \u2014 [has argued](https://www.kuow.org/stories/digital-dr-dolittle-decoding-animal-conversation-1) that the ability to understand animal signals might trigger a seismic shift in human-nonhuman relations.",

Teams may propose research in a single field of study or interdisciplinary work. NEH encourages projects that incorporate multiple points of view and pursue new avenues of inquiry. Collaborators may come from one or more institutions. NEH encourages partnerships with researchers in the natural and social sciences, but projects must focus on humanistic content and employ humanistic methods. International collaboration is welcome, but scholars at U.S. institutions must contribute significantly to the project. Proposed projects must aim to result in tangible and sustainable outcomes, such as a co-authored or multi-authored book; a themed issue of a peer-reviewed journal; a series of peer-reviewed articles; a born-digital publication; or an open-access website or other digital resource. All project outcomes must incorporate collaboration and interpretation to address significant humanities research questions. The program includes four project categories: Planning International Collaboration, Convening, Manuscript Preparation, and Scholarly Digital Projects. The categories support different project types or stages and have different performance periods and award ceilings.",
