        "title": "Law vs. Ethics: The Debate Over What's Legal and What's Right",
        "description": "Last updated: Dec 23, 2024\nBy holding people accountable for breaking the rules \u2013 often through penalties \u2013 that accountability ensures that following legal regulations works to everyone\u2019s benefit. It is also important to remember that law covers various areas. Criminal law is different than civil law, and the ethical dilemmas vary for both types of law. Constitutional law and administrative law, on the other hand, involve ethical standards. However, their ethical principles can be different than those principles relating to other fields of law. The Definition of Ethics\nEthics, by contrast, is a set of moral principles guiding what individuals and societies deem to be right or wrong. Ethical values often stem from philosophy, religion, culture, or personal beliefs, offering a framework for personal ethics regardless of a government\u2019s authority. Unlike law, which prescribes specific actions, ethics emphasizes personal growth and virtue. Ethics encourages individuals to cultivate the internal qualities that guide their behavior. Aristotle\u2019s concept of ethics as a pathway to personal virtue underlines the goal of ethics: self-improvement and human flourishing. What Are Some of the Differences Between Law and Ethics? Law has a different source of authority than ethics. Law derives its authority from formal governmental institutions, statutes, and judicial rulings.\n ... \nHe defines the triple bottom line as \"a sustainability framework that examines a company\u2019s social, environmental, and economic impact.\u201d\nIn the corporate world, business ethics and ethical standards influence:\n    * Professional conduct\n    * Company culture\n    * Managers\u2019 relationships with employees\n    * The corporation's perspective on its clients\n    * The company\u2019s conservation efforts\n    * Daily operations and business practices\n\n\u00a0\nMedical Ethics and the Law\nAnother important example where law and ethics intersect can be found in the field of medicine. Legal requirements and ethical considerations often intersect (and clash) in modern medicine. Medicine can involve complex questions \u2013 such as limiting medical care in certain situations due to a lack of resources, determining the scope of informed consent, or deciding to withhold care. Some medical situations lead to legal and ethical questions that challenge the integrity of medical professionals. These ethical dilemmas require reevaluating professional ethics on a regular basis. The medical field tries to streamline ethics into rules, but that takes time. Also, the government\u2019s involvement in the medical field makes law and ethics part of a medical professional\u2019s daily life. Freedom of Speech and Hate Speech\nAnother area that brings law and ethics together is public and political speech. The laws protecting free speech can conflict with ethical concerns about speech that causes harm or at least promotes harm.",

        "description": "Last updated: Nov 21, 2024\nThese programs also encourage people to think critically about how ethics play out in the workforce \u2014 and to navigate numerous cases from an ethical perspective while also understanding what it would take to abide by various rules and regulations. Topics covered through core courses and relevant electives include:\n\n**Understanding Legal and Regulatory Frameworks**\n\nEffective corporate governance is not possible unless professionals possess a thorough understanding of current regulatory frameworks. Many of these are sector-specific or tied to geographic locations, but many federal regulations warrant deeper discussion. M.L.S. programs reveal not only which federal regulations are relevant but also how they transpire in numerous business applications. Ethical discussions can be further built into these conversations, with case studies and projects helping students apply their newfound regulatory understanding. **Analyzing Complex Ethical Dilemmas**\n\nEthical dilemmas can be difficult to fully grasp until professionals must navigate these in the real world. An M.L.S. can provide powerful preparation through case studies and other thought-provoking learning experiences that invite students to take a closer look at the nuances of ethical concerns and how they might play out in a range of settings or situations. **Developing and Implementing Compliance Programs**\n\nIn addition to exploring the ethical implications of corporate governance, M.L.S.\n ... \nEmployees at all levels must fully understand the importance of adhering to critical regulations, and they should also be committed to upholding ethical standards, especially when these are closely tied to regulatory frameworks. Risk assessments, internal audits, and compliance management systems (CMS) can aid in ongoing efforts to maintain full compliance. **Addressing Ethical Dilemmas**\n\nEthical dilemmas abound within the [modern corporate world](https://news.miami.edu/law/stories/2025/06/navigatingcorporatesocial-responsibilitylawswith-an-mls-degree.html) . Some of these reflect the aforementioned conflicts of interest, although others may emerge even when such conflicts do not exist. These could involve everything from truthfulness in marketing to environmental responsibility, employee treatment, and data privacy. As with conflicts of interest, however, what is financially in the organization's best interests may not always align with the most ethical practices. Corporate governance can boost accountability to help leaders make ethical decisions and establish ethics-based policies, but comprehensive employee training may also be required, along with reliable reporting mechanisms. Open communication should ensure that employees feel comfortable discussing ethical concerns \u2014 but leadership must be open to change.",

The group\u2019s chief executive resigned as a result of the scandal and [VW](https://www.data.illuminem.com/company/59520c7c_volkswagen-group?utm_source=media&utm_medium=article) recalled millions of their cars the next year. ## **FAQs**\n\n### **What is ethical leadership in governance? **\n\nEthical leadership in governance is when a leader demonstrates appropriate behaviors following the key principles and values, both during or outside of working hours. In essence, ethical leaders are role models for their employees in terms of pointing out wrongdoings and upholding what\u2019s right. ### **What are ethical values in governance? **\n\nThe 8 key ethical values in governance are integrity, fairness, leadership, honesty, accountability, teamwork, charity/kindness, and loyalty. These values guarantee to protection of others against the company\u2019s self-interest and serve as a moral compass for leaders and employees. ### **What is an ethics governance framework? **\n\nThe ethics governance framework refers to the system of governance that guarantees ethical behaviours, such as the organizational structures, reporting flows, monitoring procedures, and reviewing process. This might involve setting up a separate advisory committee to make unbiased judgment calls. ### **How does ethics relate to corporate governance?\n**\n\nCorporate governance is the framework or system of how a business operates, while ethics provide the underlying values on which governance should be based to ensure fair and just decision-making. The combination of both will give you an organization that\u2019s trustworthy and successful in the long run. ## **Conclusion**\n\nEthical governance is an important part of a company, it takes into account both legal and moral aspects in decision-making. Companies should adopt ethical values and create a framework to ensure it\u2019s implemented properly. Examples of ethical practices that companies could do today are ensuring data protection, environmental sustainability in operations, providing equal opportunities, and good labor practices. As demonstrated by several case studies, failure to uphold ethical governance might lead to loss of public trust, consumer loyalty, and profit. The true value of corporate governance may not be immediate, but it will affect companies in the long run.",

Finally, we will discuss how legal professionals can integrate these principles into their practices to better serve their organizations and society. ## What Is Business Ethics? Business ethics refers to the standards and principles that govern the actions and decisions of individuals and organizations within the business environment. <sup>1</sup> Historically, business ethics has evolved from the philosophical discussions of morality and integrity. In the latter half of the 20th century, the rise of corporate scandals and the growth of global business operations necessitated a more formal approach to ethical considerations in business practices.\n ... \n<sup>4</sup> For example, a business decision may comply with the letter of the law but still be considered unethical by broader societal standards if it harms the environment or treats employees unfairly. ### Legislation Impacting Business Ethics\n\nVarious laws impact business ethics, guiding how companies conduct their operations. Examples include regulations on corporate governance, anti-corruption laws like the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), <sup>5</sup> and environmental laws like the Clean Air Act. <sup>6</sup> International laws also play a significant role, particularly in the context of global businesses that must navigate differing legal and ethical landscapes. Understanding the interplay between law and ethics helps businesses not only comply with legal requirements but also foster a culture that emphasizes ethical decision-making. This blend ensures more robust and sustainable business practices that align legal obligations with societal expectations. ## The Importance of Business Ethics and Law\n\nThe importance of business ethics and law extends beyond mere legal compliance. It creates a foundation for a positive work culture, enhances corporate reputation, and contributes to long-term business success. Companies that prioritize ethical practices and align them with legal standards are more likely to successfully navigate the complexities of the modern business landscape.",

This study posits and tests an explanatory model to investigate the extent to which institutional trust and cultural values of individualism and [collectivism](/topics/social-sciences/collectivism \"Learn more about collectivism from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") affect support for surveillance systems. The results, based upon a U.S. nationwide survey, show that individualism and collectivism intensify concerns about personal privacy and social justice. Further, institutional trust not only has a positive effect on perceived social justice, but moderates views consistent with surveillance and further enhances support for using surveillance. Implications of the findings are reviewed with respect to understanding public support for government use of network surveillance.",

Credit: jen_lipp / Flickr\nMon July 29th, 2024\nSolutions \u2022 Research \u2022 Science\nWords by Steven Rouk\n- Share on Facebook - Share on LinkedIn - Share on Whatsapp - Share on X - Share on Bluesky\n- Copy\nURL Coppied - Republish 8 min read\nRecent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) might enable us for the first time to directly translate from animal communication to human language and back again. Not only is this theoretically possible, but scientists are actively developing two-way communication with other animals. If we do gain this ability, it would have profound implications for animal rights , conservation and our understanding of animal sentience. Interspecies Communication Before AI\nOne definition of the word \u201ccommunication \u201d is \u201ca process by which information is exchanged between individuals through a common system of symbols, signs, or behavior.\u201d By this definition, humans have communicated with dogs for thousands of years to domesticate them.\nAnimal domestication typically requires a lot of communication \u2014 such as telling your dog to stay or roll over. Dogs can also be taught to communicate various wants and needs back to humans, such as ringing a bell when they need to go to the bathroom. In some cases, humans have already been able to have two-way communication with specific individuals using human language, such as when Koko the Gorilla learned to communicate using sign language . Grey parrots have also been shown to be able to learn and use speech at a similar level to very young children. However, two-way communication of this sort often requires a lot of work to establish. Even if one animal learns to communicate with a human, this skill does not translate to other members of that species. We might be able to communicate limited information back and forth with our companion animals or with a specific Grey parrot or chimpanzee, but that doesn\u2019t help us communicate with the multitude of squirrels, birds, fish, insects, deer and other animals roaming the world, each of whom has their own mode of communication. Given the groundswell of recent progress in artificial intelligence, could AI eventually open up two-way communication between humans and the rest of the animal kingdom? Accelerating Progress in Artificial Intelligence\nThe core idea at the heart of modern artificial intelligence is \u201cmachine learning,\u201d software that is good at finding useful patterns in data.",

Ethicists can help to ensure that research is conducted responsibly, while wild animal welfare researchers can ensure that these tools are being used to gather welfare-relevant data. AI can assist researchers in answering questions about wild animal welfare more accurately and efficiently \u2014 picking up on signals that are undetectable to humans, avoiding biases, and processing large volumes of data quickly. Borrowing the technologies used to decode and respond to animal communications could further accelerate and enrich the field.\nIn a [2023 paper in](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.adg7314) [_Science_](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.adg7314) _,_ Rutz et al. explain how machine learning approaches to animal communication research \u201ccould be used to identify animal signals that are associated with stress, discomfort, pain, and evasion, or with positive states.\u201d The authors write that it should be possible to \u201clisten in on [wild] animals\u2019 welfare at the landscape level\u201d using [machine learning\u2013enhanced acoustic monitoring methods](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X22004575) . And these analyses can be complemented by the development of other machine learning methods that \u201cexamine satellite-recorded animal movement tracks for signatures of disease, distress, or human avoidance.\u201d\n\n#### Which animals will we be able to talk to? Much interspecies communication work has centered on cetaceans, but learning to \"speak whale\u201d isn\u2019t the only possibility. [Technologies are now emerging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07186) that can be used to study the communication systems of any species that uses auditory signals \u2014 terrestrial mammals, birds, amphibians, and even insects. Decoding the signals of species belonging to [highly abundant](https://www.wildanimalinitiative.org/blog/maximizing-welfare) taxa like these has especially strong potential for positive welfare impact. ### **How soon will we be able to understand animals?",

If vocal expression of emotions has been conserved throughout evolution, direct between-species comparisons using the same set of acoustic indicators should be possible.\nThe present study used a machine learning algorithm (eXtreme Gradient Boosting [XGBoost]) to distinguish between contact calls indicating positive (pleasant) and negative (unpleasant) emotional valence, produced in various contexts by seven species of ungulates. With an accuracy of 89.49% (balanced accuracy: 83.90%), we found that the most important predictors of emotional valence were acoustic variables reflecting changes in duration, energy quartiles, fundamental frequency, and amplitude modulation. This approach is critical in the field of emotional communication, where more information is needed to reach a better understanding of the emotional origins of human language. In addition, these results can help toward the development of automated tools for animal well-being monitoring.

Many innovations can be protected through intellectual property (IP) rights. ## Inventions and patents\n\nInventions are the bedrock of innovation.\n ... \nHolding a patent also **makes a small business more attractive to investors** who play a key role in enabling the commercialization of a technology. 6. The technical information and business intelligence generated by the patenting process can **spark new ideas and promote new inventions** from which we can all benefit and which may, in turn, qualify for patent protection. 7. [Patent information can be mapped](https://www.wipo.int/patentscope/en/programs/patent_landscapes/) , offering policy makers useful **insights about where technology R&D is taking place and by whom** . This information can be useful in shaping policy and regulatory environment that allows innovation to thrive. 8. A patent can help **stop** unscrupulous third parties from **free riding** on the efforts of the inventor. ## **Other intellectual property rights**\n\nOther IP rights can also be used to protect a new technology, product or service. For example:\n\n**[Copyright](https://www.wipo.int/copyright/en/)** protects artistic expressions like music, films, plays, photos, artwork, works of architecture and other creative works. The term \u201ccreative works\u201d is defined very broadly for copyright purposes, such that copyright may be used to protect functional texts such as user guides and product packaging as well as works of art.",

Share On\nThe Technology Licensing Office (TLO) manages the process of obtaining patent protection and seeks parties that may be interested in developing and commercializing the technology. Once you have submitted your disclosure , TLO will determine whether or not the technology fits the criteria for patentability. Using the Research@MIT app , you can track whether or not your case is still active or closed, as well as find relevant details about your cases. Patenting Your Invention\u00a0\u00a0\nPatenting an invention gives the holder the right to exclude others from making, using, selling, offering to sell, and importing the invention. Assessing Patentability\u00a0\nThe United States Patent Office (USPTO) grants patents to inventions that meet three main criteria. The invention has to:\n    * Be novel\n    * Be non-obvious\n    * Have utility\n\n\u00a0\nOnce we have received your invention disclosure, you will be assigned to one of our experienced licensing officers who will become your main point of contact for everything. Your licensing officer will begin the assessment process, evaluating the invention tor commercial licensing potential and patentability. The patentability review is performed in consultation with patent attorneys.\n ... \nThe most successful technology transfer results are obtained when the inventor and the licensing professional work together as a team to market and promote the use of the technology. Commercializing Your Invention\u00a0\nAfter we have identified the right party to take your technology to market, the next step is to negotiate a license agreement. The TLO pursues commercial license agreements with companies that are committed to commercializing MIT\u2019s inventions. Learn More About the Licensing Process\nProduct Development\u00a0\nAfter obtaining a license, the licensee will continue the development of the technology and make investments to develop a product or service incorporating or using the MIT technology. Most licensees continue to develop an invention with the goal of meeting a market need and making the technology robust for volume commercialization. A licensee's development may include additional testing, prototyping for manufacturability, durability and integrity, and further development to improve performance and other characteristics. Documentation for training, installation, and marketing is also often created during this phase. Benchmarking tests are often required to demonstrate the product/service advantages and to position the product in the market.",

These trends reveal how internal and external forces will fundamentally reshape corporate operations and what boards need to know to stay ahead. ### Trend 1: AI-powered governance platforms will separate leaders from laggards\n\nBoard technology has evolved far beyond simple [board portals](https://www.diligent.com/resources/blog/board-portal) to become AI-enhanced governance platforms that change how directors prepare for meetings, assess risks, and make strategic decisions. This evolution is creating a competitive divide that will determine which organizations thrive in 2025's complex governance environment.\n ... \nLRN\u2019s research shows that organizations with strong ethics outperform others by up to [40% across key metrics](https://lrn.com/blog/5-oversight-areas-driving-board-of-directors-corporate-culture-responsibilities) . ### Trend 3: Ethics will be a key focus\n\nNew technology may introduce new ethical issues. AI, for example, isn\u2019t readily transparent and has biases, which can complicate data-gathering and decision-making for boards striving to offer their shareholders greater visibility. At a time when shareholders are already concerned with boardroom practices, new technology will only intensify the ethical issues boards face. Quickly evolving global regulations and AI technologies have challenged companies to ramp up. \"Implementing a robust ethical framework from the beginning of your AI strategy will keep ethical standards at the forefront \u2014 no matter what regulatory changes are up ahead. \"\u2014 Sophia Velastegui, AI expert and board member, in Diligent's [2025 risk & opportunity outlook](https://www.diligent.com/resources/research/risk-opportunity-2025) . Ethics aren\u2019t just about regulations either. AI brings numerous well-documented risks, including unintended bias and invasions of privacy. [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2022/07/why-you-need-an-ai-ethics-committee) details several questions corporate AI strategies must answer, including:\n\n* How might the AI we design, procure, and deploy present ethical risks that cannot be avoided?",

        "description": "Last updated: 7 days ago\nThere has been **a** **significant increase over the past decades in the perceived moral acceptability** of the majority of the 19 issues tested. #####\n\nAmericans\u2019 views on all of these issues have moved in the more liberal direction or show no significant change between Gallup\u2019s first measurement and our latest update. But there are interesting dynamics behind this simple comparison of the beginning and end points. Despite the long-term upticks, **we\u2019ve seen a leveling off or even a reversal in increased liberalization on many of these trends over the past several years** . The gradual and seemingly inexorable increase in acceptance of previously unacceptable behaviors, in short, has come to a halt in many instances. In the analyses that follow, I\u2019ll look at what\u2019s happening to Americans\u2019 views of each issue on a detailed basis. And to facilitate this process, I\u2019ve grouped the behaviors Gallup tracks into five categories:\n\n1. Behaviors Related to Sexual Relations and Marriage\n2. Views on the Treatment of Animals\n3. Life and Death Issues\n4. Sexual Orientation and Gender\n5. Other Behaviors\n\n## 1\\.\nBehaviors Related to Sexual Relations and Marriage\n\nSix questions on the moral acceptability list ask about behaviors related to sexuality, family structure and personal freedom:\n\n* having a baby outside of marriage\n* sex between unmarried people\n* divorce\n* sex between teenagers\n* polygamy\n* married men and women having an affair\n\n#####\n\n**Americans have, over the years, become more likely to say five of these six behaviors are morally acceptable. ** (The exception is \u201cmarried men and women having an affair\u201d; more about this below.) These broad changes reflect the increasing impact of **\u201cpersonal choice\u201d norms** in America. Individuals, the public is apparently saying, can make up their own minds about behaviors related to sexual relations and marriage. This marks a shift. A quarter century ago, Americans were significantly less likely to condone the behaviors. As noted above, however, the liberalization trend on these measures appears to have stopped. **Americans\u2019 views that these behaviors are morally acceptable have either stabilized or dropped over the past several years. **\n\nWill this moderation in Americans\u2019 long-term tendency to be more liberal on sexual and marriage norms continue? Does this mark a significant turning point in American cultural attitudes? We don\u2019t have firm answers to those questions. As any student of public opinion is aware, **there are often ups and downs in attitudinal trends** . Some of these are temporary, and underlying trends resume over time.",

        "description": "\nIn two large surveys, we find that the public does differentiate impacts, using qualities such as tangibility and scope, and we provide evidence supporting the widespread public perception that many policy decisions fail to reflect concerns about a range of social and cultural impacts. Knowing more about public perceptions of impacts could help aid the development of more equitable impact assessment procedures. ## Abstract\n\nSocial scientists and community advocates have expressed concerns that many social and cultural impacts important to citizens are given insufficient weight by decision makers in public policy decision-making. In two large cross-sectional surveys, we examined public perceptions of a range of social, cultural, health, economic, and environmental impacts. Findings suggest that valued impacts are perceived through an initial lens that highlights both tangibility (how difficult it is to understand, observe, and make changes to an impact) and scope (how broadly an impact applies). Valued impacts thought to be less tangible and narrower in scope were perceived to have less support by both decision makers and the public. Nearly every valued impact was perceived to have more support from the public than from decision makers, with the exception of three economic considerations (revenues, profits, and costs).\n ... \nThis relation appears to be stronger for public support as evidenced by the relatively steeper slope and tighter 95% CI. The bottom two panels of [Fig. 2]() show the same relations but with perceptions of the scope of each valued impact instead of tangibility on the _x_ \\-axis. There is a negative trend for both outcomes such that valued impacts perceived to be more societal/broad (i.e., larger scope) are perceived to receive more support from both the public and decision makers. Fig. 2. <img src='/cms/10.1073/pnas.2020491118/asset/fa2eb24e-5bc5-4f15-a594-4322999fd99b/assets/images/large/pnas.2020491118fig02.jpg' width='4164' height='4182' /> ( _Top_ ) The relation between perceived tangibility and perceived importance to decision makers and perceived public support. ( _Bottom_ ) The relation between perceived scope and perceived importance to decision makers and perceived public support. All valued impacts included in Study 2 are displayed. In Hypothesis 4, we predicted a difference in how members of the public rate the importance of social and cultural valued impacts as compared to how they believe decision makers will rate them. The three impacts perceived to be most highly valued by decision makers were profits, financial costs, and government revenues, whereas for public support, the top three valued impacts were water quality, physical health, and safety and security.",

It can reshape social norms, affect interactions among diverse groups, and lead to the evolution of cultural practices over time. The cultural impact during periods of expansion and imperialism is particularly evident as societies encounter new ideas, traditions, and influences that challenge or enrich their existing cultural landscapes. ## 5 Must Know Facts For Your Next Test\n\n1. Westward expansion led to the mixing of diverse cultures as settlers encountered Native American tribes, resulting in a complex cultural exchange that influenced art, language, and social practices. 2. The Gold Rush attracted a diverse group of people, including immigrants from China and Europe, contributing to California's multicultural identity and changing social dynamics. 3. The spread of new religious movements during westward expansion, like the Mormons, introduced unique belief systems that reshaped cultural landscapes in new territories. 4.\n ... \n## \" Cultural Impact \" also found in:\n\n### Subjects ( 1 )\n\n* [AP World History: Modern](/key-terms/ap-world/cultural-impact)\n\n### Guided Practice\n\n[Practice AP US History questions](/guided-practice/apush)\n\n<img src='https://storage.googleapis.com/static.prod.fiveable.me/public/favicon%20black%20gradient.png' alt='Fiveable' width='80' height='auto' />\n\n[](https://www.tiktok.com/@thinkfiveable) [](https://www.instagram.com/thinkfiveable) [](https://www.youtube.com/thinkfiveable) [](https://www.linkedin.com/company/fiveable)\n\n###### Study Content & Tools\n\n[Study Guides](/) [Practice Questions](/practice) [Glossary](/key-terms) [Score Calculators](/ap-score-calculator)\n\n###### Company\n\n[Get $$ for referrals](https://5able.me/affiliate) [Pricing](/pricing) [Testimonials](https://senja.io/p/fiveable-maI/EC6ScGS) [FAQs](/faq) [Email us](mailto:help@fiveable.me)\n\n###### Resources\n\n[AP Classes](/ap-classes) [AP Classroom](/ap-classroom)\n\n#### every AP exam is fiveable\n\n###### history\n\n[\ud83c\udf0e\ud83c\udf0e ap world history](/ap-world) [\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddf8 ap us history](/apush) [\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddfa ap european history](/ap-euro)\n\n###### social science\n\n[\u270a\ud83c\udfff\ud83c\udfff ap african american studies](/ap-african-american-studies) [\ud83d\uddf3\ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f ap comparative government](/ap-comp-gov) [\ud83d\ude9c\ud83d\ude9c ap human geography](/ap-hug) [\ud83d\udcb6\ud83d\udcb6 ap macroeconomics](/ap-macro) [\ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11 ap microeconomics](/ap-micro) [\ud83e\udde0\ud83e\udde0 ap psychology](/ap-psych-revised) [\ud83d\udc69\ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udffe\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2696\ufe0f ap us government](/ap-gov)\n\n###### english & capstone\n\n[\u270d\ud83c\udffd\ud83c\udffd ap english language](/ap-lang) [\ud83d\udcda\ud83d\udcda ap english literature](/ap-lit)",

        "description": "\nScenario planning is a process [pioneered\n by the U.S. military](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR2173z1.html) , which today runs exercises looking up to 20 years out to guide\n R&D efforts. ## Why Is Scenario Planning Important? Scenario planning can provide a competitive advantage by enabling leaders to react quickly\n and decisively \u2014 because a situation has been thought through and actions documented,\n no one has to scramble when in the midst of a crisis. Scenario planning also gives executives and boards of directors a framework to make\n nonemergency decisions more effectively by providing insight into plans, budgets and\n forecasts and painting a clearer picture of key [drivers for\n business growth](/portal/resource/articles/financial-management/the-key-drivers-and-challenges-to-international-growth-a-finance-teams-perspective.shtml) and the potential impact of future events. ### Scenario Planning Advantages and Disadvantages\n\nA comprehensive scenario planning exercise takes time, effort and money. Should you commit? ### _Advantages:_\n\n* Scenario planning will help executives understand the effects of various plausible\n   events. * Finance, operations and other teams can prepare initial responses. * There's an element of knowledge management; by having key\n   personnel take part, the company captures their insights and recommendations. * If these stakeholders are unavailable during an actual extreme event, the company has\n   documentation to fall back on.\n ... \n## Scenario Planning Work Approach\n\n### Actions to take\n\n1. Secure commitments from senior management, select team members and organize scenarios\n    around key issues to be addressed and evaluated. 2. Define assumptions clearly, establish relationships between drivers and limit the number\n    of scenarios created. 3. Make sure each scenario presents a logical view of the future. 4. Focus on material differences between scenarios. 5. Indicate KPIs, and refresh scenarios and update assumptions on a regular basis. ### Actions to avoid\n\n1. Avoid developing scenarios without defining the issues first. 2. Don't develop too many scenarios \u2013 three is a good starting point. Beginning with\n    your best guess at how business will go, add one scenario for things going better and\n    another for things going worse. A good starting point is 50% for best guess, then 25%\n    for things going better and 25% for things going worse. 3. Do not attempt to develop the perfect scenario \u2013 more detail does not mean more\n    accuracy. 4. Avoid becoming fixated on any one scenario. 5. Don't hold on to a scenario after it has ceased to be relevant. ## 3 Steps to Better Scenario Planning\n\n### 1\\. Identify critical triggers even in the midst of uncertainty:\n\nWhen faced with a crisis, finance leaders quickly establish guidelines for how the\n organization should respond by developing multiple scenarios.",

        "description": "\n[Explore scenario planning with SAP](//www.sap.com/products/financial-management/financial-planning-analysis-fpa.html)\n\n## Scenario planning meaning and definition\n\nScenario planning looks at different future scenarios and considers varied combinations of assumptions and events. These scenarios are not predictions or forecasts but alternative views of how the future could unfold. By analyzing these scenarios, organizations can anticipate potential challenges and opportunities, helping them to react effectively as events unfold. Developed initially for military strategies and later embraced by the corporate world, scenario planning is beneficial in uncertain, complex, or rapidly changing environments. It allows organizations to test strategies against possible future states, understand the impacts of recent decisions, and increase their preparedness for unexpected events. Essentially, scenario planning shifts the focus from trying to predict the future to understanding the dynamics that will shape it. ## Why is scenario planning important? In an ever-evolving global landscape, uncertainties abound. Whether they be geopolitical changes, market fluctuations, or technological advancements, these uncertainties can significantly impact an organization\u2019s future. Scenario planning is essential as it helps organizations to navigate these uncertainties by envisaging various outcomes and preparing strategies accordingly.",

It helps organizations shift from reactive to proactive decisionmaking and planning, enabling them to anticipate and prepare for future uncertainties. The strategic foresight approach enables organizations to become more resilient in the face of change and prepares them for whatever the future might hold, even in times of significant uncertainty. By taking a proactive and flexible approach, an organization can better navigate future challenges, allowing it to adapt and succeed in rapidly changing environments.",

Within these intricate natural systems we cannot manage species independently, as they are all part of a greater ecosystem, each living thing connected by a complex network to the next living organism. To repair and restore ecosystems we must understand historical and current biodiversity exists and what are the threats to base conservation decisions on. With a little over 1 million acres of land to protect, here we introduce one of the core elements to our conservation strategy at Great Plains; Biodiversity Monitoring.\n<img src='https://greatplainsfoundation.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2022-GreatPlains-Okavango-Explorers-Camp-AHP-93-scaled.jpg' alt='2022 GreatPlains Okavango Explorers Camp AHP 93 scaled' width='2560' height='1438' />\n\n<img src='https://greatplainsfoundation.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/GPF_-29-scaled.jpg' alt='GPF  29 scaled' width='2560' height='1440' />\n\n<img src='https://greatplainsfoundation.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2023-GP-Botswana-Experiences-AHP-77-scaled.jpg' alt='2023 GP Botswana Experiences AHP 77 scaled' width='2560' height='1707' />\n\nBiodiversity, defined as \u2018all living things and their interactions\u2019, is by nature constantly changing as it adapts to internal, external, natural and anthropogenic factors. Biodiversity Monitoring is the systematic observation and recording of ongoing fluctuations in species populations and distributions determining the diversity status. We are looking at trends of wildlife populations and distribution and then ecologically impactful scenarios such as drought, fires and flooding. We look to be able to include a wide variety of variables in our monitoring from large to small, as more often than not it is the small things such as a butterfly species or dragonfly that can be the greatest indicator of the health of the habitat. Building long-term biodiversity data sets is essential for implementing conservation tools such as adaptive management.",

        "description": "Last updated: Dec 23, 2024\nBy holding people accountable for breaking the rules \u2013 often through penalties \u2013 that accountability ensures that following legal regulations works to everyone\u2019s benefit. It is also important to remember that law covers various areas. Criminal law is different than civil law, and the ethical dilemmas vary for both types of law. Constitutional law and administrative law, on the other hand, involve ethical standards. However, their ethical principles can be different than those principles relating to other fields of law. The Definition of Ethics\nEthics, by contrast, is a set of moral principles guiding what individuals and societies deem to be right or wrong. Ethical values often stem from philosophy, religion, culture, or personal beliefs, offering a framework for personal ethics regardless of a government\u2019s authority. Unlike law, which prescribes specific actions, ethics emphasizes personal growth and virtue. Ethics encourages individuals to cultivate the internal qualities that guide their behavior. Aristotle\u2019s concept of ethics as a pathway to personal virtue underlines the goal of ethics: self-improvement and human flourishing. What Are Some of the Differences Between Law and Ethics? Law has a different source of authority than ethics. Law derives its authority from formal governmental institutions, statutes, and judicial rulings.\nBecause law is created and enforced by recognized authorities, it holds the power to compel individuals and organizations to conform to specific rules. In legal terms, laws are valid regardless of ethics, including individual beliefs or moral perspectives. Ethics stem from cultural norms and/or religious beliefs. Ethics does not depend on formal institutions for validation \u2013 ethics are based on individual and collective moral judgments and are not enforced by the political power of the government that compels obedience. Aristotle highlighted this distinction, noting that ethics is a \u201creasoned choice\u201d rather than a mandated obligation. When Aristotle defined the purpose of law, he emphasized its role in regulating behavior and maintaining public order. Aristotle referred to the Politeia (political community) and how law serves a practical, utilitarian function in governance. Aristotle also explained there is room in the legal system to ensure justice. While the legal system often reflects societal values, it primarily seeks to govern interactions among individuals and groups. The function of law is primarily external, as it governs actions rather than internal motivations. An ethical obligation, in other words, might be reflected in legal rules, but not all wrong actions are illegal by definition. New legislation does not always deal with ethical issues and will not always follow moral standards, since public order and regulation of behavior outweigh normative ethics.",

        "description": "\nIn two large surveys, we find that the public does differentiate impacts, using qualities such as tangibility and scope, and we provide evidence supporting the widespread public perception that many policy decisions fail to reflect concerns about a range of social and cultural impacts. Knowing more about public perceptions of impacts could help aid the development of more equitable impact assessment procedures. ## Abstract\n\nSocial scientists and community advocates have expressed concerns that many social and cultural impacts important to citizens are given insufficient weight by decision makers in public policy decision-making. In two large cross-sectional surveys, we examined public perceptions of a range of social, cultural, health, economic, and environmental impacts. Findings suggest that valued impacts are perceived through an initial lens that highlights both tangibility (how difficult it is to understand, observe, and make changes to an impact) and scope (how broadly an impact applies). Valued impacts thought to be less tangible and narrower in scope were perceived to have less support by both decision makers and the public. Nearly every valued impact was perceived to have more support from the public than from decision makers, with the exception of three economic considerations (revenues, profits, and costs).\n ... \nIn addition, we are also interested in exploring differences between public perceptions of the importance placed on different impacts by decision makers and the lay public. H4: In general, social and cultural impacts will be perceived as less important to decision makers as compared to the public at large. ## Methods\n\nTo address these four hypotheses, we conducted two large surveys of the US public. We used nearly identical methods in both studies, with Study 2 acting as a replication in a nationally representative sample of the US public. We therefore discuss the methods and results of these studies together. All study materials and procedures were approved by the Decision Research Institutional Review Board. All participants provided informed consent before participating in this research. The data for Studies 1 and 2 are publicly available on the Open Science Framework at <https://osf.io/pgq62/> . ### Design Sources for Valued Impacts and Qualities. Our selection of the valued impacts used in these studies was based on several sources. The first was formal legislation governing impact assessment requirements such as regulations under the US National Environmental Protection Act ( [25]() ), the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act ( [26]() ), and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People ( [27]() ).",

Scenario planning can provide a competitive advantage by enabling leaders to react quickly\n and decisively \u2014 because a situation has been thought through and actions documented,\n no one has to scramble when in the midst of a crisis. Scenario planning also gives executives and boards of directors a framework to make\n nonemergency decisions more effectively by providing insight into plans, budgets and\n forecasts and painting a clearer picture of key [drivers for\n business growth](/portal/resource/articles/financial-management/the-key-drivers-and-challenges-to-international-growth-a-finance-teams-perspective.shtml) and the potential impact of future events. ### Scenario Planning Advantages and Disadvantages\n\nA comprehensive scenario planning exercise takes time, effort and money. Should you commit? ### _Advantages:_\n\n* Scenario planning will help executives understand the effects of various plausible\n   events. * Finance, operations and other teams can prepare initial responses. * There's an element of knowledge management; by having key\n   personnel take part, the company captures their insights and recommendations. * If these stakeholders are unavailable during an actual extreme event, the company has\n   documentation to fall back on.\n ... \nThis\n scenario will show how the last period's sales figures compare with forecasts, and what\n adjustments you need to make on headcount and other departmental spending to maintain\n trajectory. The high scenario is usually based on demand increasing and sales accelerating\n due to big changes in the market. The goal is to ramp up capacity without incurring costs\n that eat into margins. ### 4\\. Provide break-even analysis:\n\nThis analysis will support, with data, decision-making regarding your cash-flow break-even\n level. It looks at the minimum sales volume your company needs to keep operating normally\n and sales compensation plans to see if you need to adjust commissions or bonuses. _Rami Ali is a senior product marketing manager at Oracle NetSuite.

It\u2019s also used to identify new and emerging trends. This activity is often based on desk research, assisting in the development of the big picture of future changes. A solid horizon scanning process can help develop strategies to align with future changes. It can also be a way of identifying new trends which are later used in scenarios. ### Scenarios\n\n**Scenario planning** helps organizations anticipate change, prepare responses, and create robust strategies. The process typically starts with the combining of known facts about the operating environment with uncertain factors about the future context.

Interspecies Communication Before AI\nOne definition of the word \u201ccommunication \u201d is \u201ca process by which information is exchanged between individuals through a common system of symbols, signs, or behavior.\u201d By this definition, humans have communicated with dogs for thousands of years to domesticate them.\nAnimal domestication typically requires a lot of communication \u2014 such as telling your dog to stay or roll over. Dogs can also be taught to communicate various wants and needs back to humans, such as ringing a bell when they need to go to the bathroom. In some cases, humans have already been able to have two-way communication with specific individuals using human language, such as when Koko the Gorilla learned to communicate using sign language . Grey parrots have also been shown to be able to learn and use speech at a similar level to very young children. However, two-way communication of this sort often requires a lot of work to establish. Even if one animal learns to communicate with a human, this skill does not translate to other members of that species. We might be able to communicate limited information back and forth with our companion animals or with a specific Grey parrot or chimpanzee, but that doesn\u2019t help us communicate with the multitude of squirrels, birds, fish, insects, deer and other animals roaming the world, each of whom has their own mode of communication. Given the groundswell of recent progress in artificial intelligence, could AI eventually open up two-way communication between humans and the rest of the animal kingdom? Accelerating Progress in Artificial Intelligence\nThe core idea at the heart of modern artificial intelligence is \u201cmachine learning,\u201d software that is good at finding useful patterns in data.",

        "description": "Last updated: May 31, 2025\nThese unsupervised machine translation models have since been used to translate between languages as different to one another as English, [Mandarin](https://aclanthology.org/P18-1005/) , and [Urdu](https://journals.uol.edu.pk/JCSA/article/view/3536) , and to work on [audio recordings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10191) as well as written language. Researchers now believe that, once they gather enough recordings of animal vocalizations and behaviors, they may be able to use unsupervised machine translation to \u201cdecode\u201d the vocalizations of any species. And once we understand the meanings of these signals, AI speech generators could enable us to respond. ### **Is AI animal language translation ethical? **\n\nWhether we _should_ respond is a subject of fierce debate. Some of the thorny questions surrounding interspecies communication are those that animal communication researchers have always grappled with: Is it an invasion of privacy to record animals without their consent? What are the welfare impacts of [broadcasting the sounds of predators to songbirds to test how they respond](https://publish.uwo.ca/~lzanette/papers/santema-beheco.pdf) , and can they be justified by the knowledge a study will yield? What welfare concerns might arise from [playing animals signals whose meanings we don\u2019t yet know](https://peerj.com/articles/16349/) ?\n ... \nIn a [2023 paper in](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.adg7314) [_Science_](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.adg7314) _,_ Rutz et al. explain how machine learning approaches to animal communication research \u201ccould be used to identify animal signals that are associated with stress, discomfort, pain, and evasion, or with positive states.\u201d The authors write that it should be possible to \u201clisten in on [wild] animals\u2019 welfare at the landscape level\u201d using [machine learning\u2013enhanced acoustic monitoring methods](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X22004575) . And these analyses can be complemented by the development of other machine learning methods that \u201cexamine satellite-recorded animal movement tracks for signatures of disease, distress, or human avoidance.\u201d\n\n#### Which animals will we be able to talk to? Much interspecies communication work has centered on cetaceans, but learning to \"speak whale\u201d isn\u2019t the only possibility. [Technologies are now emerging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07186) that can be used to study the communication systems of any species that uses auditory signals \u2014 terrestrial mammals, birds, amphibians, and even insects. Decoding the signals of species belonging to [highly abundant](https://www.wildanimalinitiative.org/blog/maximizing-welfare) taxa like these has especially strong potential for positive welfare impact. ### **How soon will we be able to understand animals?",

These studies serve various purposes, including industrial applications such as monitoring animals on farms and supporting veterinarians in diagnosing animal diseases 15 . Numerous algorithms and tools have been developed to facilitate research in this field, such as the BIRDNET app, which specializes in identifying bird species based on their vocalizations 16 . However, inter-species analysis of emotional animal vocalizations based on machine learning technologies remains largely unexplored in the existing literature. Current research considers a limited range of species-specific vocalizations. Ruiz-Miranda et al. 17 examined the physical characteristics of domestic goat vocalizations in response to the cries of their offspring. Briefer et al. 18 investigated how the social environment and kinship influence contact calls during the early development of goats. Furthermore, Baciadonna et al. 19 demonstrated that goats can distinguish between vocalizations related to positive and negative emotions, suggesting the potential for their use in animal welfare monitoring 20 . Interestingly, the closest paper to this work is presented in 21 and proposes the use of handcrafted features along with traditional machine learning approaches to classify emotional states across various species.",

[Image](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/plugins/Basic/assets/placeholder.60f9b1840c.svg)\n\nWe are dedicated to ecological restoration and harnessing technology to support nature-based solutions that address climate change and biodiversity loss. One of the ways to measure our impact is through bioacoustics \u2014 capturing and analyzing the sounds of wildlife, such as birds, to monitor species presence, abundance, and behaviour over time. ## **Why Birds? **\n\nBirds are invaluable indicators of ecological health and restoration success due to their sensitivity to environmental changes, diverse habitat range, and the advanced capabilities of bioacoustics technology in monitoring their populations and behaviours. They often serve as umbrella species, meaning their well-being reflects the health of other species and the broader ecosystem. For example, changes in bird populations can indicate issues such as habitat loss or pollution. \u200d\n\n!\n ... \nAnother crucial input for the MLM is the local species catalog, which lists all the unique species in a specific area. By combining multiple data sources, we create a robust master data catalog that enhances and validates our bioacoustic detections. Using the processed audio files and the local species catalog, the MLM predicts which species are present. After detection and identification, we perform a secondary analysis to derive key indicators, such as species richness, providing deeper insights into the health of the ecosystem. \u200d\n\n### **Output**\n\nBioacoustic sensors enable veritree to achieve accurate species identification, abundance estimation, and monitoring of habitat quality over time without physically observing or capturing the birds. Corporate partners can also easily access user-friendly outputs for their planting projects, including visuals of species, descriptions, relevant taxonomy, and audio recordings, through the corporate partner portal. These resources are part of veritree\u2019s ongoing measurement and monitoring efforts. \u200d\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nBioacoustics is an innovative approach to assessing the health of local ecosystems and ensuring the effectiveness and sustainability of our restoration efforts. We specifically focus on birds as they are highly responsive to alterations in their habitats, making them effective indicators of ecological shifts.",

        "description": "\nMany animals produce sound for communication and navigation, from birds and bats to marine mammals, fish, amphibians and many invertebrates. By doing this, they broadcast information about themselves into their environment. For researchers, this can offer rich data about where species are, how big their populations are, and what they\u2019re doing. This makes remote sound recorders \u2013 often called \u2018acoustic sensors\u2019 \u2013 potentially a useful, cost-effective way for ecologists to survey wildlife populations, animal behaviour and ecological communities. ### the modern acoustic sensor\n\n<img src='/sites/default/files/inline-images/instrument-2_0.png' alt='the modern acoustic sensor' width='437' height='387' /> In recent years the popularity of this technology, known as passive acoustic monitoring (or just \u2018acoustic monitoring\u2019) has grown very rapidly. This has happened because of recent advances in the technology, which has taken advantage of innovations for consumer technology such as smartphones, often taking advantage of innovations for consumer tech like smartphones: the hardware has become smaller and cheaper, and audio analysis software has become much more sophisticated. This means that portable, weatherproof acoustic sensors for wildlife monitoring are quickly dropping in cost, making it feasible to use them for a variety of ecology and conservation research.\nSimultaneously, new developments in machine learning and computer vision are making it possible to automatically extract useful ecological information from many hours of sound recordings. Animals use sound for communication, echolocation, sexual display, and territorial defence, and bioacoustic monitoring involves the recording of those sounds to infer animal distribution, physiological state, abundance, and behaviour. <img src='/sites/default/files/styles/content_slide_image/public/2018-04/acustic-image-1.jpg?h=777222db&itok=ZQkR2ywg' width='1000' height='600' />\n\n## NEW OPPORTUNITIES\n\n**This emerging technology offers a wealth of opportunities for ecology and conservation research. **\n\nSimilarly to camera traps, many remote acoustic sensors can be deployed in the field for many weeks or months, collecting recordings of wildlife and their surroundings in a non-invasive way. These can be analysed to provide information on species distributions, behaviour and populations, to build up a picture of communities of vocalising animals in a survey area, and to understand the relationship between animals and their acoustic environment (the \u2018soundscape\u2019). These approaches are increasingly used in applied conservation, for monitoring endangered species, understanding habitat use, and listening for sounds associated with illegal activity such as gunshots and chainsaw noise.",

It\u2019s easier to find useful patterns if you have a lot of data to learn from . Easy access to massive amounts of data on the Internet is part of the reason why artificial intelligence has gotten so much better in recent years. Researchers are also figuring out how to write better software that can find more complex, useful patterns in the data that we have. With rapidly improving algorithms and an abundance of data, we seem to have reached a tipping point in the last few years where powerful new AI tools have become possible, taking the world by storm with their surprising usefulness. It turns out these same approaches can be applied to animal communication, too. The Rise of AI in Animal Communication Research\nAnimals, including human animals, make noises and body expressions that are all just different types of data \u2014 audio data, visual data and even pheromone data . Machine learning algorithms can take that data and use it to detect patterns. With the help of animal welfare scientists, AI can help us figure out that one noise is the sound of a happy animal, while a different noise is the sound of an animal in distress .",

Models that have prioritized acoustic signals simply because they\u2019re so central to human communication may need to abandon this bias if they are to solve this puzzle. But if machine learning models are eventually able to map and decode multimodal animal communication systems, the data they provide may be much more comprehensive, nuanced, and widely applicable than what researchers have so far been able to infer about communication and welfare.

These studies serve various purposes, including industrial applications such as monitoring animals on farms and supporting veterinarians in diagnosing animal diseases 15 . Numerous algorithms and tools have been developed to facilitate research in this field, such as the BIRDNET app, which specializes in identifying bird species based on their vocalizations 16 . However, inter-species analysis of emotional animal vocalizations based on machine learning technologies remains largely unexplored in the existing literature. Current research considers a limited range of species-specific vocalizations. Ruiz-Miranda et al. 17 examined the physical characteristics of domestic goat vocalizations in response to the cries of their offspring. Briefer et al. 18 investigated how the social environment and kinship influence contact calls during the early development of goats. Furthermore, Baciadonna et al. 19 demonstrated that goats can distinguish between vocalizations related to positive and negative emotions, suggesting the potential for their use in animal welfare monitoring 20 . Interestingly, the closest paper to this work is presented in 21 and proposes the use of handcrafted features along with traditional machine learning approaches to classify emotional states across various species.",

[Image](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/plugins/Basic/assets/placeholder.60f9b1840c.svg)\n\nWe are dedicated to ecological restoration and harnessing technology to support nature-based solutions that address climate change and biodiversity loss. One of the ways to measure our impact is through bioacoustics \u2014 capturing and analyzing the sounds of wildlife, such as birds, to monitor species presence, abundance, and behaviour over time. ## **Why Birds? **\n\nBirds are invaluable indicators of ecological health and restoration success due to their sensitivity to environmental changes, diverse habitat range, and the advanced capabilities of bioacoustics technology in monitoring their populations and behaviours. They often serve as umbrella species, meaning their well-being reflects the health of other species and the broader ecosystem. For example, changes in bird populations can indicate issues such as habitat loss or pollution. \u200d\n\n!\n ... \nAnother crucial input for the MLM is the local species catalog, which lists all the unique species in a specific area. By combining multiple data sources, we create a robust master data catalog that enhances and validates our bioacoustic detections. Using the processed audio files and the local species catalog, the MLM predicts which species are present. After detection and identification, we perform a secondary analysis to derive key indicators, such as species richness, providing deeper insights into the health of the ecosystem. \u200d\n\n### **Output**\n\nBioacoustic sensors enable veritree to achieve accurate species identification, abundance estimation, and monitoring of habitat quality over time without physically observing or capturing the birds. Corporate partners can also easily access user-friendly outputs for their planting projects, including visuals of species, descriptions, relevant taxonomy, and audio recordings, through the corporate partner portal. These resources are part of veritree\u2019s ongoing measurement and monitoring efforts. \u200d\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nBioacoustics is an innovative approach to assessing the health of local ecosystems and ensuring the effectiveness and sustainability of our restoration efforts. We specifically focus on birds as they are highly responsive to alterations in their habitats, making them effective indicators of ecological shifts.",

        "description": "\nMany animals produce sound for communication and navigation, from birds and bats to marine mammals, fish, amphibians and many invertebrates. By doing this, they broadcast information about themselves into their environment. For researchers, this can offer rich data about where species are, how big their populations are, and what they\u2019re doing. This makes remote sound recorders \u2013 often called \u2018acoustic sensors\u2019 \u2013 potentially a useful, cost-effective way for ecologists to survey wildlife populations, animal behaviour and ecological communities. ### the modern acoustic sensor\n\n<img src='/sites/default/files/inline-images/instrument-2_0.png' alt='the modern acoustic sensor' width='437' height='387' /> In recent years the popularity of this technology, known as passive acoustic monitoring (or just \u2018acoustic monitoring\u2019) has grown very rapidly. This has happened because of recent advances in the technology, which has taken advantage of innovations for consumer technology such as smartphones, often taking advantage of innovations for consumer tech like smartphones: the hardware has become smaller and cheaper, and audio analysis software has become much more sophisticated. This means that portable, weatherproof acoustic sensors for wildlife monitoring are quickly dropping in cost, making it feasible to use them for a variety of ecology and conservation research.\nSimultaneously, new developments in machine learning and computer vision are making it possible to automatically extract useful ecological information from many hours of sound recordings. Animals use sound for communication, echolocation, sexual display, and territorial defence, and bioacoustic monitoring involves the recording of those sounds to infer animal distribution, physiological state, abundance, and behaviour. <img src='/sites/default/files/styles/content_slide_image/public/2018-04/acustic-image-1.jpg?h=777222db&itok=ZQkR2ywg' width='1000' height='600' />\n\n## NEW OPPORTUNITIES\n\n**This emerging technology offers a wealth of opportunities for ecology and conservation research. **\n\nSimilarly to camera traps, many remote acoustic sensors can be deployed in the field for many weeks or months, collecting recordings of wildlife and their surroundings in a non-invasive way. These can be analysed to provide information on species distributions, behaviour and populations, to build up a picture of communities of vocalising animals in a survey area, and to understand the relationship between animals and their acoustic environment (the \u2018soundscape\u2019). These approaches are increasingly used in applied conservation, for monitoring endangered species, understanding habitat use, and listening for sounds associated with illegal activity such as gunshots and chainsaw noise.",

        "description": "Last updated: Mar 8, 2022\nBusiness leaders must constantly look for new ways to innovate because you can't solve many problems with old solutions. Innovation is critical across all industries; however, it's important to avoid using it as a buzzword and instead take time to thoroughly understand the innovation process. Here's an overview of innovation in business, why it's important, and how you can encourage it in the workplace. ## What Is Innovation? Innovation and creativity are often used synonymously. While similar, they're not the same. Using [creativity in business is important](/blog/post/importance-of-creativity-in-business) because it fosters [unique ideas](/blog/post/how-to-come-up-with-a-business-idea) . This novelty is a key component of innovation. For an idea to be innovative, it must also be useful. Creative ideas don't always lead to innovations because they don't necessarily produce viable solutions to problems. Simply put: **Innovation** is a product, service, business model, or strategy that's both novel and useful. Innovations don't have to be major breakthroughs in technology or new business models; they can be as simple as upgrades to a company's customer service or features added to an existing product. * * *\n\nFree E-Book: So You Want to Be an Entrepreneur: How to Get Started\n\nAccess your free e-book today.",

These innovations have come in response to exponentially higher demands for computing capacity, memory, and networking for AI training and inference, as well as a need to manage cost, heat, and electric power consumption. This has given rise to a slew of new products, new competitors, and new ecosystems. Technology trends also have a variety of profiles along the dimensions we analyzed. AI is a widely applicable, general-purpose technology with use cases in every industry and business function\u2014and thus lots of innovation and interest\u2014and it is scaling rapidly across the business landscape. Quantum technologies have a different profile. Quantum computing has the potential for transformative impact in certain critical domains, such as cryptography and material science, and the basic technology continues to be developed. Recent announcements, particularly by technology giants, have sparked increased interest, but real-world business impact will require even more technology advancements to make quantum computing practical.\nOther trends and subtrends vary across the multiple dimensions we analyzed, offering different approaches\u2014from watchful waiting to aggressive deployment\u2014to business leaders depending on their industries and competitive positions. From the rise of robotics and autonomous systems to the imperative for responsible AI innovations, this year\u2019s technology developments underscore a future where technology is more adaptive, collaborative, and integral to solving global problems. This is illuminated by themes that cut across trends this year:\n\n* _The rise of autonomous systems._ Autonomous systems, including physical robots and digital agents, are moving from pilot projects to practical applications. These systems aren\u2019t just executing tasks; they\u2019re starting to learn, adapt, and collaborate. Autonomy is moving toward broad deployment, whether through coordinating last-mile logistics, navigating dynamic environments, or acting as virtual coworkers, among other skills. * _New human\u2013machine collaboration models._ Human\u2013machine interaction is entering a new phase defined by more natural interfaces, multimodal inputs, and adaptive intelligence. From immersive training environments and haptic robotics to voice-driven copilots and sensor-enabled wearables, technology is becoming more responsive to human intent and behavior.",

        "description": "\nIn two large surveys, we find that the public does differentiate impacts, using qualities such as tangibility and scope, and we provide evidence supporting the widespread public perception that many policy decisions fail to reflect concerns about a range of social and cultural impacts. Knowing more about public perceptions of impacts could help aid the development of more equitable impact assessment procedures. ## Abstract\n\nSocial scientists and community advocates have expressed concerns that many social and cultural impacts important to citizens are given insufficient weight by decision makers in public policy decision-making. In two large cross-sectional surveys, we examined public perceptions of a range of social, cultural, health, economic, and environmental impacts. Findings suggest that valued impacts are perceived through an initial lens that highlights both tangibility (how difficult it is to understand, observe, and make changes to an impact) and scope (how broadly an impact applies). Valued impacts thought to be less tangible and narrower in scope were perceived to have less support by both decision makers and the public. Nearly every valued impact was perceived to have more support from the public than from decision makers, with the exception of three economic considerations (revenues, profits, and costs).\n ... \nIn addition, we are also interested in exploring differences between public perceptions of the importance placed on different impacts by decision makers and the lay public. H4: In general, social and cultural impacts will be perceived as less important to decision makers as compared to the public at large. ## Methods\n\nTo address these four hypotheses, we conducted two large surveys of the US public. We used nearly identical methods in both studies, with Study 2 acting as a replication in a nationally representative sample of the US public. We therefore discuss the methods and results of these studies together. All study materials and procedures were approved by the Decision Research Institutional Review Board. All participants provided informed consent before participating in this research. The data for Studies 1 and 2 are publicly available on the Open Science Framework at <https://osf.io/pgq62/> . ### Design Sources for Valued Impacts and Qualities. Our selection of the valued impacts used in these studies was based on several sources. The first was formal legislation governing impact assessment requirements such as regulations under the US National Environmental Protection Act ( [25]() ), the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act ( [26]() ), and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People ( [27]() ).",

As people start talking more about mental issues, they are more than happy to open up concerning themselves and seek help within their communities, which establishes an empathetic culture with better understanding. Also the recent wellness trends from the mindful practices to fitness have raised the importance of maintaining well-being in today\u2019s modern world. **Section 10. ** Pop Culture: Pop culture continues to inform society\u2019s values and trends. Whether in the form of music or sitcoms, the stories and characters we\u2019re exposed to may reflect our perception of race, gender, mental health and other issues. Given the zeal for authenticity and truthful storytelling in the minds of creators, pop culture is an effective impetus to discuss and drive social change. **Section 12. ** Education Redesigned: The approach to teaching and learning is changing, giving more prominence to experiential learning, critical thinking, and emotional intelligence. The conventional education system, with technology and personalized experiences, will make the student more prepared for a dynamic world.

        "description": "\nIt also deals with the impact of these patterns over time. Emerging issues , on the other hand, are \u201cevents\u201d that do not seem to fit into any existing patterns, but which may develop new ones. Horizon Scanning\nHorizon scanning is the systematic gathering of information to detect early signs of potentially important developments. It\u2019s also used to identify new and emerging trends. This activity is often based on desk research, assisting in the development of the big picture of future changes. A solid horizon scanning process can help develop strategies to align with future changes. It can also be a way of identifying new trends which are later used in scenarios. Scenarios\nScenario planning helps organizations anticipate change, prepare responses, and create robust strategies. The process typically starts with the combining of known facts about the operating environment with uncertain factors about the future context. Then, one selects a number of these \u2018uncertainties\u2019 or \u2018drivers of change\u2019 in the future and converts plausible paths of developments into two or more alternative stories or \u2018scenarios\u2019. As the future unfolds, some paths generally begin to emerge as more plausible and others as less plausible. Often, the future involves a combination of paths. The Delphi Method\nThe Delphi Method is a structured and interactive forecasting activity that relies on a panel of experts. The experts answer questionnaires and argue different positions.\nThis is usually done over a few rounds. During this process, the range of answers narrows down. This is based on the reassessment of given arguments and consensus-building. In the final round, the group of experts converges toward a final, \u201ccorrect\u201d answer about the future. MAKING YOUR ORGANIZATION FUTURE PROOF\nSuccessful companies understand the importance of foresight analysis. Even if they don\u2019t call it that, oftentimes, they do one or more of the above methods yearly in order to stay ahead of the competition. But a truly successful foresight program needs more than incorporating these methods in strategy work. These foresight methods are part of a larger whole \u2013 a company-wide program that enables any organization to become future-proof. SUMMARY\nHere is a summary of the foresight analysis methods covered in this blog post:\n    * Forecasts and Predictions\n    * War Game Simulations\n    * Roadmaps\n    * Backcasting\n    * Weak signals and wild cards\n    * Trends and Emerging Issues Analysis\n    * Horizon Scanning\n    * Scenarios\n    * The Delphi Method\n\nFutures Platform is your trusted companion in stratregic foresight.

        "description": "\nScenario planning is a process [pioneered\n by the U.S. military](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR2173z1.html) , which today runs exercises looking up to 20 years out to guide\n R&D efforts. ## Why Is Scenario Planning Important? Scenario planning can provide a competitive advantage by enabling leaders to react quickly\n and decisively \u2014 because a situation has been thought through and actions documented,\n no one has to scramble when in the midst of a crisis. Scenario planning also gives executives and boards of directors a framework to make\n nonemergency decisions more effectively by providing insight into plans, budgets and\n forecasts and painting a clearer picture of key [drivers for\n business growth](/portal/resource/articles/financial-management/the-key-drivers-and-challenges-to-international-growth-a-finance-teams-perspective.shtml) and the potential impact of future events. ### Scenario Planning Advantages and Disadvantages\n\nA comprehensive scenario planning exercise takes time, effort and money. Should you commit? ### _Advantages:_\n\n* Scenario planning will help executives understand the effects of various plausible\n   events. * Finance, operations and other teams can prepare initial responses. * There's an element of knowledge management; by having key\n   personnel take part, the company captures their insights and recommendations. * If these stakeholders are unavailable during an actual extreme event, the company has\n   documentation to fall back on.\n ... \nThis\n scenario will show how the last period's sales figures compare with forecasts, and what\n adjustments you need to make on headcount and other departmental spending to maintain\n trajectory. The high scenario is usually based on demand increasing and sales accelerating\n due to big changes in the market. The goal is to ramp up capacity without incurring costs\n that eat into margins. ### 4\\. Provide break-even analysis:\n\nThis analysis will support, with data, decision-making regarding your cash-flow break-even\n level. It looks at the minimum sales volume your company needs to keep operating normally\n and sales compensation plans to see if you need to adjust commissions or bonuses. _Rami Ali is a senior product marketing manager at Oracle NetSuite.

This paper reviews ethical theories, governance models, and implementation strategies that enable responsible AI integration in business contexts. It explores how ethical theories such as utilitarianism, deontology, and virtue ethics inform practical models for AI deployment. Furthermore, the paper investigates governance structures and stakeholder roles in shaping accountability and transparency, and examines frameworks that guide strategic risk assessment and decision-making.\n ... \n[www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/1619029/frai-08-1619029-HTML/image_m/frai-08-1619029-t001.jpg)](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/1619029/frai-08-1619029-HTML/image_m/frai-08-1619029-t001.jpg)\n\n**Table 1** . Comparative overview of ethical theories applied to AI contexts. ### 2\\.2 Responsible AI governance models\n\nThe term \u201cresponsible AI governance\u201d refers to the systems put in place by businesses to deal with the moral questions raised by AI. Some of the most important ideas in responsible AI governance that have been discussed in the literature are stakeholder involvement, openness, justice, and accountability. According to [Zhang and Lu (2021)]() , these topics are essential for resolving public worries over prejudice, discrimination, and the possible abuse of AI systems. Integrating responsible AI concepts into governance frameworks is crucial, according to a systematic review by [Batool et al. (2023)]() . To reduce the dangers of AI deployment and make sure that ethics are part of AI development from the start, this integration is crucial. There is a notable void in academic research and practical implementation, as the review finds no comprehensive frameworks that fully address these ideas. Finding out who is responsible for AI system decisions is a major issue in AI governance. Organizational executives and legislators should also be involved in holding developers accountable ( [Morley et al., 2023]() ).",

        "description": "Last updated: Jan 2, 2025\nSpecifically, some of the primary corporate governance best practices include:\n\n* Recruiting and building a competent board\n* Aligning strategies with goals\n* Exercising accountability\n* Having a high level of ethics and integrity\n* Defining roles and responsibilities\n* Managing risk effectively\n\n### 1\\. Recruit effective and diverse board directors\n\nA prominent way for boards to do their collective best pertains to [board refreshments](https://www.diligent.com/resources/videos/board-refreshment-strategic-needs) . As the economic climate has changed, the composition of boards has needed to change with it. For example, while [environmental, social and governance (ESG)](https://www.diligent.com/resources/guides/esg) skills have been at the top of board wish lists in recent years, [most boards now expect to focus](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/governance-insights-center/library/assets/pwc-uncertainty-and-transformation-2024.pdf) on core skills like finances and operations in the coming year. Achieving [board effectiveness](https://www.diligent.com/resources/blog/effective-board-management) in corporate governance starts with taking a fresh look at their nominating and [recruitment procedures](https://institute.uschamber.com/best-practices-in-board-governance/) . A good first step is to develop recruitment packets with honest information about the organization.\n ... \nThe board must work together to develop the company\u2019s risk tolerance and risk profile. Additionally, they need to ensure that the company has [the proper framework](https://www.diligent.com/resources/blog/what-is-governance-framework) and controls in place so they can [monitor risk](https://www.diligent.com/resources/blog/it-risk-management-best-practices) and mitigate it when necessary. Corporate governance best practices require board directors to examine risk and strategy on a short and long-term basis. The board will engage in routine oversight of risk management/ [enterprise risk management (ERM)](https://www.diligent.com/resources/guides/enterprise-risk-management-framework) , whether that takes the form of a risk register, heat map or other framework. The board will oversee [recommended risk mitigations](https://www.diligent.com/resources/blog/risk-management-plans-for-the-board-of-directors) and ensure that the organization has [appropriate controls](https://www.diligent.com/resources/blog/internal-controls) and resources. ### 6\\. Hold directors accountable\n\nThe many scandals that have made headlines demonstrate why accountability has such a strong position in best practices for corporate governance. Boards need to develop strong internal controls and monitor them often. Accurate, transparent reporting systems with adequate checks and balances are considered important parts of corporate governance best practices.",

        "description": "Last updated: Aug 14, 2025\nFor instance, CHAI recently partnered with The Joint Commission (TJC) to create an evidence-based certification process aligned with Medicare accreditation standards. This marks a shift from aspirational principles toward enforceable governance norms for AI in healthcare. ## **Conclusion**\n\nThe five standards described above\u2014 OECD AI principles, UNESCO Recommendation on AI ethics, AI RMF, ISO 42001, and IEEE 7000\u2014are complementary rather than competing; all encourage ethical and responsible AI technology development but serve different purposes. OECD and UNESCO establish broad policy frameworks that can serve as a foundation for any organization developing or deploying AI systems. The AI RMF provides a flexible, non-certifiable structure for AI risk assessment, while ISO 42001 provides specific practices and controls for building and running an AI governance system that is certifiable. An organization might use the AI RMF for initial risk assessment and governance planning, and then implement ISO 42001 for formal certification and a more systematic management of its AI systems. And IEEE 7000 provides a standards-based design process applicable to any system type, ensuring that all stakeholders\u2019 values are considered and implemented throughout system development. Organizations can layer these approaches to translate high-level ethical principles and AI risk management structures into concrete AI management controls and design standards.\n ... \n[Pro Bono](/our-story/pro-bono)\n* [Community Impact](/our-story/community-impact)\n* [Accolades](/our-story/accolades)\n\nOur Blogs\n\n* [Budding Trends](https://www.buddingtrendsblog.com/)\n* [BuildSmart](https://www.buildsmartbradley.com/)\n* [Business Divorce](https://www.bradleybusinessdivorce.com/)\n* [Eye on Enforcement](https://www.eyeonenforcement.com/)\n* [Financial Services Perspectives](https://www.financialservicesperspectives.com/)\n* [IP IQ](https://www.ipiqblog.com/)\n* [It Pays to Be Covered](https://www.itpaystobecovered.com/)\n* [Labor & Employment Insights](https://www.employmentlawinsights.com)\n* [Online and On Point](https://www.onlineandonpoint.com/)\n\nLearn about the latest news, announcements and upcoming events on the topics that are important to you and your business.",

But there are interesting dynamics behind this simple comparison of the beginning and end points. Despite the long-term upticks, **we\u2019ve seen a leveling off or even a reversal in increased liberalization on many of these trends over the past several years** . The gradual and seemingly inexorable increase in acceptance of previously unacceptable behaviors, in short, has come to a halt in many instances. In the analyses that follow, I\u2019ll look at what\u2019s happening to Americans\u2019 views of each issue on a detailed basis. And to facilitate this process, I\u2019ve grouped the behaviors Gallup tracks into five categories:\n\n1. Behaviors Related to Sexual Relations and Marriage\n2. Views on the Treatment of Animals\n3. Life and Death Issues\n4. Sexual Orientation and Gender\n5. Other Behaviors\n\n## 1\\.\nBehaviors Related to Sexual Relations and Marriage\n\nSix questions on the moral acceptability list ask about behaviors related to sexuality, family structure and personal freedom:\n\n* having a baby outside of marriage\n* sex between unmarried people\n* divorce\n* sex between teenagers\n* polygamy\n* married men and women having an affair\n\n#####\n\n**Americans have, over the years, become more likely to say five of these six behaviors are morally acceptable. ** (The exception is \u201cmarried men and women having an affair\u201d; more about this below.) These broad changes reflect the increasing impact of **\u201cpersonal choice\u201d norms** in America. Individuals, the public is apparently saying, can make up their own minds about behaviors related to sexual relations and marriage. This marks a shift. A quarter century ago, Americans were significantly less likely to condone the behaviors. As noted above, however, the liberalization trend on these measures appears to have stopped. **Americans\u2019 views that these behaviors are morally acceptable have either stabilized or dropped over the past several years. **\n\nWill this moderation in Americans\u2019 long-term tendency to be more liberal on sexual and marriage norms continue? Does this mark a significant turning point in American cultural attitudes? We don\u2019t have firm answers to those questions. As any student of public opinion is aware, **there are often ups and downs in attitudinal trends** . Some of these are temporary, and underlying trends resume over time.",

        "description": "\nIn two large surveys, we find that the public does differentiate impacts, using qualities such as tangibility and scope, and we provide evidence supporting the widespread public perception that many policy decisions fail to reflect concerns about a range of social and cultural impacts. Knowing more about public perceptions of impacts could help aid the development of more equitable impact assessment procedures. ## Abstract\n\nSocial scientists and community advocates have expressed concerns that many social and cultural impacts important to citizens are given insufficient weight by decision makers in public policy decision-making. In two large cross-sectional surveys, we examined public perceptions of a range of social, cultural, health, economic, and environmental impacts. Findings suggest that valued impacts are perceived through an initial lens that highlights both tangibility (how difficult it is to understand, observe, and make changes to an impact) and scope (how broadly an impact applies). Valued impacts thought to be less tangible and narrower in scope were perceived to have less support by both decision makers and the public. Nearly every valued impact was perceived to have more support from the public than from decision makers, with the exception of three economic considerations (revenues, profits, and costs).\n ... \nThis relation appears to be stronger for public support as evidenced by the relatively steeper slope and tighter 95% CI. The bottom two panels of [Fig. 2]() show the same relations but with perceptions of the scope of each valued impact instead of tangibility on the _x_ \\-axis. There is a negative trend for both outcomes such that valued impacts perceived to be more societal/broad (i.e., larger scope) are perceived to receive more support from both the public and decision makers. Fig. 2. <img src='/cms/10.1073/pnas.2020491118/asset/fa2eb24e-5bc5-4f15-a594-4322999fd99b/assets/images/large/pnas.2020491118fig02.jpg' width='4164' height='4182' /> ( _Top_ ) The relation between perceived tangibility and perceived importance to decision makers and perceived public support. ( _Bottom_ ) The relation between perceived scope and perceived importance to decision makers and perceived public support. All valued impacts included in Study 2 are displayed. In Hypothesis 4, we predicted a difference in how members of the public rate the importance of social and cultural valued impacts as compared to how they believe decision makers will rate them. The three impacts perceived to be most highly valued by decision makers were profits, financial costs, and government revenues, whereas for public support, the top three valued impacts were water quality, physical health, and safety and security.",

It can reshape social norms, affect interactions among diverse groups, and lead to the evolution of cultural practices over time. The cultural impact during periods of expansion and imperialism is particularly evident as societies encounter new ideas, traditions, and influences that challenge or enrich their existing cultural landscapes. ## 5 Must Know Facts For Your Next Test\n\n1. Westward expansion led to the mixing of diverse cultures as settlers encountered Native American tribes, resulting in a complex cultural exchange that influenced art, language, and social practices. 2. The Gold Rush attracted a diverse group of people, including immigrants from China and Europe, contributing to California's multicultural identity and changing social dynamics. 3.

        "description": "\nScenario planning is a process [pioneered\n by the U.S. military](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR2173z1.html) , which today runs exercises looking up to 20 years out to guide\n R&D efforts. ## Why Is Scenario Planning Important? Scenario planning can provide a competitive advantage by enabling leaders to react quickly\n and decisively \u2014 because a situation has been thought through and actions documented,\n no one has to scramble when in the midst of a crisis. Scenario planning also gives executives and boards of directors a framework to make\n nonemergency decisions more effectively by providing insight into plans, budgets and\n forecasts and painting a clearer picture of key [drivers for\n business growth](/portal/resource/articles/financial-management/the-key-drivers-and-challenges-to-international-growth-a-finance-teams-perspective.shtml) and the potential impact of future events. ### Scenario Planning Advantages and Disadvantages\n\nA comprehensive scenario planning exercise takes time, effort and money. Should you commit? ### _Advantages:_\n\n* Scenario planning will help executives understand the effects of various plausible\n   events. * Finance, operations and other teams can prepare initial responses. * There's an element of knowledge management; by having key\n   personnel take part, the company captures their insights and recommendations. * If these stakeholders are unavailable during an actual extreme event, the company has\n   documentation to fall back on.\n ... \n## Scenario Planning Work Approach\n\n### Actions to take\n\n1. Secure commitments from senior management, select team members and organize scenarios\n    around key issues to be addressed and evaluated. 2. Define assumptions clearly, establish relationships between drivers and limit the number\n    of scenarios created. 3. Make sure each scenario presents a logical view of the future. 4. Focus on material differences between scenarios. 5. Indicate KPIs, and refresh scenarios and update assumptions on a regular basis. ### Actions to avoid\n\n1. Avoid developing scenarios without defining the issues first. 2. Don't develop too many scenarios \u2013 three is a good starting point. Beginning with\n    your best guess at how business will go, add one scenario for things going better and\n    another for things going worse. A good starting point is 50% for best guess, then 25%\n    for things going better and 25% for things going worse. 3. Do not attempt to develop the perfect scenario \u2013 more detail does not mean more\n    accuracy. 4. Avoid becoming fixated on any one scenario. 5. Don't hold on to a scenario after it has ceased to be relevant. ## 3 Steps to Better Scenario Planning\n\n### 1\\. Identify critical triggers even in the midst of uncertainty:\n\nWhen faced with a crisis, finance leaders quickly establish guidelines for how the\n organization should respond by developing multiple scenarios.",

These scenarios are not predictions or forecasts but alternative views of how the future could unfold. By analyzing these scenarios, organizations can anticipate potential challenges and opportunities, helping them to react effectively as events unfold. Developed initially for military strategies and later embraced by the corporate world, scenario planning is beneficial in uncertain, complex, or rapidly changing environments. It allows organizations to test strategies against possible future states, understand the impacts of recent decisions, and increase their preparedness for unexpected events. Essentially, scenario planning shifts the focus from trying to predict the future to understanding the dynamics that will shape it. ## Why is scenario planning important? In an ever-evolving global landscape, uncertainties abound. Whether they be geopolitical changes, market fluctuations, or technological advancements, these uncertainties can significantly impact an organization\u2019s future. Scenario planning is essential as it helps organizations to navigate these uncertainties by envisaging various outcomes and preparing strategies accordingly.",

Credit: jen_lipp / Flickr\nMon July 29th, 2024\nSolutions \u2022 Research \u2022 Science\nWords by Steven Rouk\n- Share on Facebook - Share on LinkedIn - Share on Whatsapp - Share on X - Share on Bluesky\n- Copy\nURL Coppied - Republish 8 min read\nRecent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) might enable us for the first time to directly translate from animal communication to human language and back again. Not only is this theoretically possible, but scientists are actively developing two-way communication with other animals. If we do gain this ability, it would have profound implications for animal rights , conservation and our understanding of animal sentience. Interspecies Communication Before AI\nOne definition of the word \u201ccommunication \u201d is \u201ca process by which information is exchanged between individuals through a common system of symbols, signs, or behavior.\u201d By this definition, humans have communicated with dogs for thousands of years to domesticate them.\nAnimal domestication typically requires a lot of communication \u2014 such as telling your dog to stay or roll over. Dogs can also be taught to communicate various wants and needs back to humans, such as ringing a bell when they need to go to the bathroom. In some cases, humans have already been able to have two-way communication with specific individuals using human language, such as when Koko the Gorilla learned to communicate using sign language . Grey parrots have also been shown to be able to learn and use speech at a similar level to very young children. However, two-way communication of this sort often requires a lot of work to establish. Even if one animal learns to communicate with a human, this skill does not translate to other members of that species. We might be able to communicate limited information back and forth with our companion animals or with a specific Grey parrot or chimpanzee, but that doesn\u2019t help us communicate with the multitude of squirrels, birds, fish, insects, deer and other animals roaming the world, each of whom has their own mode of communication. Given the groundswell of recent progress in artificial intelligence, could AI eventually open up two-way communication between humans and the rest of the animal kingdom? Accelerating Progress in Artificial Intelligence\nThe core idea at the heart of modern artificial intelligence is \u201cmachine learning,\u201d software that is good at finding useful patterns in data.",

Ethicists can help to ensure that research is conducted responsibly, while wild animal welfare researchers can ensure that these tools are being used to gather welfare-relevant data. AI can assist researchers in answering questions about wild animal welfare more accurately and efficiently \u2014 picking up on signals that are undetectable to humans, avoiding biases, and processing large volumes of data quickly. Borrowing the technologies used to decode and respond to animal communications could further accelerate and enrich the field.\nIn a [2023 paper in](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.adg7314) [_Science_](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.adg7314) _,_ Rutz et al. explain how machine learning approaches to animal communication research \u201ccould be used to identify animal signals that are associated with stress, discomfort, pain, and evasion, or with positive states.\u201d The authors write that it should be possible to \u201clisten in on [wild] animals\u2019 welfare at the landscape level\u201d using [machine learning\u2013enhanced acoustic monitoring methods](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X22004575) . And these analyses can be complemented by the development of other machine learning methods that \u201cexamine satellite-recorded animal movement tracks for signatures of disease, distress, or human avoidance.\u201d\n\n#### Which animals will we be able to talk to? Much interspecies communication work has centered on cetaceans, but learning to \"speak whale\u201d isn\u2019t the only possibility. [Technologies are now emerging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07186) that can be used to study the communication systems of any species that uses auditory signals \u2014 terrestrial mammals, birds, amphibians, and even insects. Decoding the signals of species belonging to [highly abundant](https://www.wildanimalinitiative.org/blog/maximizing-welfare) taxa like these has especially strong potential for positive welfare impact. ### **How soon will we be able to understand animals?",

If vocal expression of emotions has been conserved throughout evolution, direct between-species comparisons using the same set of acoustic indicators should be possible.\nThe present study used a machine learning algorithm (eXtreme Gradient Boosting [XGBoost]) to distinguish between contact calls indicating positive (pleasant) and negative (unpleasant) emotional valence, produced in various contexts by seven species of ungulates. With an accuracy of 89.49% (balanced accuracy: 83.90%), we found that the most important predictors of emotional valence were acoustic variables reflecting changes in duration, energy quartiles, fundamental frequency, and amplitude modulation. This approach is critical in the field of emotional communication, where more information is needed to reach a better understanding of the emotional origins of human language. In addition, these results can help toward the development of automated tools for animal well-being monitoring.

        "description": "\nThrough rigorous observation of animal actions and interactions, researchers and observers can glean valuable insights into diverse facets of their lives, encompassing health, social dynamics, ecological relationships, and neuroethological dimensions. Although state-of-the-art deep learning models have demonstrated remarkable accuracy in classifying various forms of animal data, their adoption in animal behavior studies remains limited. This survey article endeavors to comprehensively explore deep learning architectures and strategies applied to the identification of animal behavior, spanning auditory, visual, and audiovisual methodologies. The survey categorizes techniques into pose estimation-based and non-pose estimation-based methods, analyzing their applications, effectiveness, and limitations. Furthermore, the manuscript scrutinizes extant animal behavior datasets, offering a detailed examination of the principal challenges confronting this research domain. The article culminates in a comprehensive discussion of key research directions within deep learning that hold potential for advancing the field of animal behavior studies. * Previous article in issue\n* Next article in issue\n\n## Keywords\n\nAnimal behavior\n\nDeep learning\n\nPose estimation\n\nObject detection\n\nBio-acoustics\n\nMachine learning\n\nRecommended articles\n\n## Data availability\n\nNo data was used for the research described in the article. ## Cited by (0)\n\n\u00a9 2025 The Author(s).",

New products or innovations are necessary to stay ahead of the competition and customer expectations. According to McKinsey , 80 to 90% of executives feel that innovation and new products are essential for their growth strategy. However, the same report also states that only 6% of business executives are satisfied with their current innovation levels. A clearer picture of the challenges related to new product development can help us understand why organizations struggle to succeed in such a critical area. Some of these challenges include:\nMarket changes and ever-evolving consumer demands:\nToday\u2019s consumers have access to a myriad of brands and products, meaning businesses must provide new, innovative products quickly or risk losing customers. However, the pace at which the market and customer trends change has made it increasingly difficult for businesses to keep up. Understanding/controlling supply chain and resource costs:\nCreating and introducing new products is typically an expensive process.\n ... \nHow a Product Portfolio Management Solution Helps Optimize New Product Development\nManaging the seven stages of new product development requires a carefully planned, systematic approach. At each stage, product commercialization leaders need visibility into data, cross-functional workflows, and resources to identify opportunities to avoid developing products that will not generate revenue or be successful in the marketplace. Compared to their more static counterparts, digital-forward product portfolio management solutions better provide the data visibility, work management, and analytical capabilities new product development and commercialization managers need. By consolidating all product development-related work into a shared, easily accessible knowledge base, these solutions act as a hub of collaborative work focused on aligning new products in a portfolio with strategic objectives. Successfully Navigate the Innovation Landscape with Planview\nThe seven stages of new product development provide organizations with a strategic pathway to successfully create and launch innovative products.

        "description": "Last updated: Jun 14, 2023\n**\n\n[Product commercialization](https://www.boston-engineering.com/expertise/commercialization/) refers to the process of introducing a new product or service into the market and making it available for sale to consumers. It involves all the activities and strategies that transform an idea, concept, or prototype into a marketable product. Commercialization is a crucial step in the product development cycle and involves various stages, including market research, product design and development, manufacturing, marketing, and sales. ## **Why use the Product Commercialization Process? **\n\nSuccessfully commercializing a product requires cross discipline coordination and a systematic approach to maximize the return on your product development investment. A company that excels in commercialization is able to provide a broader range of products to its customers, increase company revenues, increase overall efficiencies and stay at the forefront of their market. The specific pathway to success varies across industries, but the challenges remain the same: Understanding the Market and its needs, Technology and its possibilities, Engineering and its opportunities, Capitalization and its scalability, and ultimately Production and its capabilities.\n ... \n[Subscribe to our Monthly Newsletter](https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/21108934/c0423d17-340b-4977-9b7e-567ee867605e.png)](https://cta-redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/21108934/c0423d17-340b-4977-9b7e-567ee867605e)\n\nTags: [Product Development](https://blog.boston-engineering.com/tag/product-development) , [Commercialization](https://blog.boston-engineering.com/tag/commercialization)\n\n[Back to Blog](https://blog.boston-engineering.com)\n\n* [Tweet](https://twitter.com/share)\n\n## Related Articles\n\n[](https://blog.boston-engineering.com/from-idea-to-reality-conceptual-design-in-product-commercialization)\n\n## [From Idea to Reality: Conceptual Design in Product Commercialization](https://blog.boston-engineering.com/from-idea-to-reality-conceptual-design-in-product-commercialization)\n\nConceptual design is a critical step in the engineering phase of product commercialization, as it...\n\n[Read More](https://blog.boston-engineering.com/from-idea-to-reality-conceptual-design-in-product-commercialization)\n\n[](https://blog.boston-engineering.com/product-commercialization-6-key-technology-elements-and-strategies)\n\n## [Product Commercialization: 6 Key Technology Elements and Strategies](https://blog.boston-engineering.com/product-commercialization-6-key-technology-elements-and-strategies)\n\nThe technology phase of product commercialization involves developing and refining the core...\n\n[Read",
